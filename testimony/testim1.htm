<strong></strong><center><strong>Statement of Daniel Greenwood, Deputy General Counsel
For The Information Technology Division Of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts
Before The Domestic and International Monetary Policy Subcommittee Of The
Committee on Banking and Financial Services Of The
United States House of Representatives
</strong><p>
<strong>July 9, 1997</strong></p></center>
<p> Mr. Chairman, members of the Subcommittee, I appreciate the
opportunity to participate in this important hearing on a Federal Role
in Electronic Authentication. I am pleased to share the views on
legislation developed in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts based on our
experiences both using and promoting authentication techniques for
electronic commerce. As Deputy General Counsel for the Information
Technology Division (ITD) for the Commonwealth, I have had ample
occasion to focus on the ramifications of electronic commerce from a
legal, practice, and technology oriented perspective. The Commonwealth
of Massachusetts is home to several electronic commerce companies and
our state government is a robust user of electronic commerce
technology. In essence, the Commonwealth favors an incremental and
pro-market policy in legislation and regulation at this time.
</p><p> Many people are questioning whether electronic signature law
should be enacted at the state level or preempted by federal law. The
Commonwealth believes that electronic signatures are relevant as a part
of broader electronic commerce policy and should be viewed in that
context rather than in isolation. The question is not one of state
versus federal law, but how each level of government should coordinate.
The law, policy and practice related to electronic commerce are too
important and pervasive to be under the sole jurisdiction or influence
of any single level or branch of government. </p><p> The Commonwealth is having a very positive experience using
electronic commerce to achieve cost savings and service quality
enhancements by making important state government transactions
available over the Internet for citizens and business. Citizens can use
a credit card over a secure Internet connection to renew their vehicle
registration, pay a citation and even to order a vanity license plate.
Vendors that do business with the Commonwealth can access official
requests for proposals over the state's web site and will be able to
submit bids in the future. Our most recent transaction allows banks to
conduct secure and authenticated Internet filings with the
Massachusetts Division of Banks. We believe the citizens would rather
be on-line than in line when dealing with government. There are a
number of different information technologies that can be deployed for
secure electronic commerce and our policy has been to promote use of
multiple technologies and a competitive marketplace for electronic
commerce services and products. </p><p> It is unrealistic to assume that all conflicts can be
preempted out of existence. At the legislative, regulatory and policy
levels, governments will have to coordinate actions because electronic
commerce is multi-jurisdictional by nature. For instance, among state
governments and between the states and the federal government, it is
vital that a citizen or business dealing with the government not be
burdened with inconsistent or conflicting technical or legal
requirements. To this end, state and federal government must coordinate
policies on electronic filings, registrations, licensing and other
online transactions. </p><p> In the narrow but important area of public key cryptography,
for instance, Massachusetts is cooperating with several other lead
states and three national associations of state governments to accredit
certification authorities. This accreditation project is aimed at
producing consistent standards among states and other parties who would
purchase or rely on digital certificates of identity in electronic
commerce. This project serves as a market driven but coordinated
approach to protect certification authorities from conflicting
requirements by different governments and other large users. A wide
array of private sector electronic commerce partners and the federal
government have been part of the planning of this pilot. Such efforts
can be far more fruitful than legislation for the purpose of
accelerating electronic commerce by working out practical obstacles.
</p><p> Important though it may be, perhaps too much emphasis has been
paid to the role of Government as law maker. An initial, and probably
counterproductive, assumption is often made that the lack of a
comprehensive statutory and regulatory framework is holding back
electronic commerce. The Administration of Governor William Weld has
found consistently over the past six years that restraining the
government impulse to regulate private enterprise results in more, not
less, economic activity. The Weld Administration has recently concluded
an unprecedented phaseout of antiquated or overly burdensome regulation
throughout every corner of the state bureaucracy. Particularly in an
area as dynamic and fast growing as the information technology economy,
government at all levels must temper the regulatory urge with a healthy
respect for the power of markets to develop the least costly, highest
quality most efficient technical, business and contractual solutions.
Government remains, of course, a player in the online market by virtue
of consumer power and transactional standards setting. However, the
electronic commerce market will not be regulated or legislated into
existence, but it will emerge as a result of supply and demand. As the
market develops, legislation or regulation can be crafted to deal
specifically with market failures that may emerge with respect to
consumers, corporate market needs, criminality and other public
concerns. To attempt to legislate solutions to problems that have
largely not yet happened in a market that is still not fully formed
risks harmful market distortions and other unintended consequences.
</p><p> It is clear, however, that certain legislative reforms will be
needed to remove legal obstacles from the path of private sector
parties who use electronic commerce as part of their business. Some
legal reforms are largely under the jurisdictions of the states. For
instance, the law of contracts has traditionally been a matter for
state law. Similarly, the specific question of electronic
authentication often boils down to an issue of evidence. This is an
issue of proof of the identity of a party to a transaction or other
online activity. To the extent these matters are tried in state courts
applying state rules of evidence, this too is a matter of state law.
Just one month ago, in the case of DOHERTY v. REGISTRY OF MOTOR
VEHICLES, a Massachusetts district court ruled that an e-mail message
qualified as a writing signed under the pains of perjury. State courts
have, for centuries, proven to be quite capable of adjudicating
commercial disputes between parties from multiple jurisdictions and
dealing with technological advances. Concerns over state government
competence to continue in this field are not called for. In fact,
states are often better suited to produce innovative, responsive and
accountable policy models than the federal government. </p><p> In recognition of the novel issues raised by electronic
transactions generally (including authentication issues) the states are
in the process of drafting uniform state law governing electronic
contracts, licenses and other private transactions. The uniform law
drafting process affords an open, deliberate process that is necessary
to arrive at sound, informed legislation in this area. However, while
uniform law drafting proceeds, some legal reforms may be ripe for
action in the mean time. For instance, the Massachusetts General Laws
provide some 4,515 separate references to documents that must be in
writing and/or signed. Some laws require writings "on paper" and
signatures "in ink." These laws are strewn throughout the laws and
regulations of states and the federal government. Such "quill pen"
laws, in many cases, hale from an industrial age (and occasionally from
agrarian times) and serve as antiquated senseless impediments to
electronic commerce. The repeal or reform of such laws should be
undertaken in a coordinated and consistent fashion at all levels of
government. Similarly, federal and state tax policy should be tailored
to promote electronic commerce and existing or contemplated regulation
of electronic commerce should be seriously reconsidered in light of the
importance of market driven solutions and robust competition in this
field. </p><p> The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has proposed the creation
of an online, web-based conference area to facilitate communication
between and among states and the federal government regarding
electronic signature and authentication legislation, regulation and
policy. We are pleased to work with the newly formed United States
Innovation Partnership on this project. The USIP is a joint effort of
the National Governors Association, the White House Office of Science
and Technology Policy and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of
Commerce. When this web site is operational, we will be happy to inform
the Subcommittee of the http address. The Commonwealth has also drafted
a survey to collect and share views on the proper balance between
state, federal and international law for electronic signatures. This
survey has been published on the Internet, in the BNA, and other
periodicals and results are still coming in. When the results are
complete, we will forward a report to the Subcommittee for your
information.
</p><p> There are many opportunities for state and federal law to form
a consistent legal framework in support of the emerging information
society. Needed international coordination will have to be spearheaded
by the federal government. Such issues as export, copyright, patent,
federal tax and federal procurement will also have an important impact.
Areas such as uniform commercial law, general contract law and state
rules of evidence, on the other hand, will need to be carefully evolved
by the states in light of federal and international electronic commerce
policy. On a going forward basis, more forums and opportunities for
communication between levels of government are needed to avoid the
crafting of inconsistent policy or misunderstandings about the roles of
each stakeholder.
</p><p>Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to testify today.
If the Subcommittee would like deeper background on these matters, I
would encourage you to visit the ITD web site, available at
www.state.ma.us/itd/legal. As you continue to work on these important
issues, the Commonwealth would be honored to provide the Subcommittee
with assistance in the future. I would be pleased to answer any
questions the Subcommittee may have at this time.
