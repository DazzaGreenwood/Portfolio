<P>Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity
to testify today on Senate Bill 2107, the Government Paperwork Elimination
Act.&nbsp; I am the Deputy General Counsel for the Information Technology
Division of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.&nbsp; I am here today in
that capacity to share some of the experiences we have had at the state
government level as we have attempted to implement the same types of efforts
that are the centerpiece of S.2107.&nbsp; Though making forms available
for filing over the Internet is only a part of the complex combination
of legal, business and technical challenges related to bringing government
into the information age, it is a logical and constructive step.&nbsp;
This legislation will help to move the federal government in the right
direction.

<P>The Commonwealth of Massachusetts supports the basic principle that
government should fully utilize information technologies as a means to
control costs and to enhance the quality of government services.&nbsp;
Making the federal government more accessible via the Internet will be
advantageous to Massachusetts citizens, businesses and to our state government
as well.&nbsp; All businesses and citizens of the Commonwealth would potentially
benefited from the bill you consider today because we all must interact
with the federal government.&nbsp; The use of forms comprises a significant
portion of that activity.&nbsp; The ability to retrieve, complete and submit
such forms over the Internet will create a more efficient, less costly
and higher service quality experience for citizens and businesses who are
obliged to interact with the federal government through the use of forms.&nbsp;
Similarly, the state government of Massachusetts, as an organization, has
many interfaces with our federal partners.&nbsp; The regulation of health
care, banking and financial services, public safety, environmental affairs
and transportation constitute just a few activities which bring state government
into direct contact with incalculably numerous federal forms on a daily
basis.&nbsp; Clearly, the ability to complete, authenticate and transmit
these forms over the Internet would be a welcome innovation from the point
of view of a state government.

<P>The benefits associated with making government available for business
online are potentially great.&nbsp; See the Online Government Task Force
Report for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts [<A HREF="http://www.state.ma.us/itd/onlinegv/">www.state.ma.us/itd/onlinegv/</A>]
for our view of the efficiencies, cost reductions and service quality enhancements
that result from making government accessible via the Internet.&nbsp; However,
legislation can be an overly blunt tool for use in the delicate and dynamic
realm of Internet transactions.&nbsp; From the perspective of a state government
that has experience implementing such initiatives, I would urge the Committee
to consider the potential difficulties with provisions of the bill as currently
drafted which seem to favor use of a particular business model, such as
the trusted third party model, and a use of a particular technical implementation,
such as digital certificates.

<P>Given the rapid growth, number of options and dynamic change that characterize
the electronic commerce marketplace, federal legislation of this type must
stop short of picking technology winners and losers before the market has
finished evolving the best solutions.&nbsp; The Senate version of this
legislation adds language that addresses this concern:&nbsp; Section 7
(c) of S.2107 provides that the technical standards specified by the Department
of Commerce be "technology neutral" and not favor any one industry sector.&nbsp;
This would, it is hoped, hold open the gates of choice in government procurement
rather than locking into a solution that may become obsolete in a quick
changing market, or worse, which may itself stifle innovation by private
sector competitors for whom the federal market is significant.&nbsp; This
last point is especially true with respect to this legislation, given the
fact that it not only effects the market for direct federal procurement,
but also the vast array of private systems in use by every citizen and
business that use federal forms.&nbsp; Technology neutrality in legislation
should involve more than avoiding industry bias.&nbsp; The current draft
provisions in the Senate version should be either broadly interpreted to
address technologies rather than just industries or it should be amended
to reach the intended goals of the bill.

<P>Section 7 of both the Senate and House versions of this bill would also
require the Department of Commerce to develop standards for the use of
digital signatures which are "compatible with standards and technology
for digital signatures used in commerce and industry and by State governments."&nbsp;
It will be critical for government at all levels to maintain technical
standards that are consistent with the standards and technology used in
commerce and industry generally.&nbsp; This section indicates that federal
standards should be consistent not only with private sector standards,
but also with those of the state governments.&nbsp; This is a refreshing
and welcome provision and I predict it will engender significant good will
among the states in support of the difficult and large-scale goals of this
legislation.

<P>The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and several other states participate
in any number of technical and standards setting bodies in which we attempt
to maintain a consistent face of government at the state and federal levels.&nbsp;
Section 7 of S.2107 serves as an important signal from Congress that the
federal government is serious about working with states to prevent the
possible introduction of conflicts between our approaches.&nbsp; At the
same time, the legislation avoids direct preemption or other methods to
force state government compliance with federal standards.&nbsp; I believe
this approach by the federal government will be appreciated by state officials
who are working on the same problems and who recognize that we really are
all in this together, at all levels of government.&nbsp; S.2107 articulates
a way to harness the solution-oriented activity at state and federal levels
collaboratively.&nbsp; This standard should apply to the entire set of
technical issues related to making federal forms available for filing over
the Internet, not only for the special issues associated with digital signatures.

<P>Another significant provision in Section 7 would require the Department
of Commerce to set standards that assure "a digital signature shall be
as reliable as is appropriate for the purpose for which an electronic message
containing a digital signature is generated, in light of all the circumstances,
including any relevant agreement."&nbsp; This language is consistent with
legislative initiatives at the state and international levels.&nbsp; The
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law first popularized
this general language in their Model Law on Electronic Commerce.&nbsp;
Since then, the concept has gained wide attention in state law reform efforts,
including by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State
Law.&nbsp; This concept is important because it would assure a rule of
proportionality between the security and authentication measures that are
selected and the genuine level of safety required based upon a cost, benefit
and risk assessment for a given transaction.

<P>The reliability associated with security and authentication for a given
form will differ depending on the context in which the form exists.&nbsp;
The differences will not only be quantitative (i.e.: "how much security
is needed") but also qualitative (i.e.: "what kinds of technology are appropriate
for this transaction, given the parties, business and existing systems").&nbsp;
Certainly, questions like "how much money is at risk" and "is there private
data involved" are classic issues to address and will vary depending on
the particular form.&nbsp; Beyond such basic issues, implementers will
also need to consider such question as whether they are dealing with a
relatively closed and sophisticated community, like a set of under 100
large companies that file a particular regulatory form on a regular basis.&nbsp;
In such a case, existing communications channels may suffice to provide
the needed security and authentication.&nbsp; In cases where any member
of the citizenry might spontaneously and for the first time file a form,
then the technical and practical solutions may well be different.

<P>Some existing requirements for signatures on forms may need to be reassessed
as the forms are made available online.&nbsp; Some signature lines on forms
enjoy absolutely no requirement basis in law or common sense but exist
only because at some point in the past someone put it there.&nbsp; The
process of putting so many forms on the Internet will reveal many opportunities
to reformulate the need to authenticate the filer.&nbsp; There are several
situations in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts where we have found that
online forms can be processed with no special identification and authentication
of the filer - even where a payment may be required to fulfill the requested
form.&nbsp; In these cases, our more precise requirements analysis demonstrated
that there was no need for additional levels of costly authentication technology
or regulatory mandates on the filer.&nbsp; Again, see the <A HREF="http://www.state.ma.us/itd/onlinegv/">Online
Government Task Force Report</A> for more details and examples of the Massachusetts
experience.

<P>Generally, the provisions of the current legislation that provide goals
and outcomes for implementers should be favored over provisions that detail
technical requirements within the statute itself.&nbsp; For example, the
requirement in Section 2, which would mandate that online forms be "substantially
identical in content and requirements to any corresponding paper versions"
may provide too much detail regarding the final implementation requirements.&nbsp;
I can think of any number of examples where forms that have been put online
have been significantly improved to take advantage of the additional functionality
of the digital media.&nbsp; Requiring online forms to be "substantially
identical" to "corresponding" paper forms may chill improvement and perpetuate
flaws.&nbsp; Unless this type of language is amended, then words like "identical"
would have to be interpreted as "identical in purpose" or "similar in form."&nbsp;
Too often, the well intentioned technical specificity found in legislation
of this type ends up creating barriers to the most efficient and highest
value implementations.&nbsp; The legislative trick is to create definite
mandates and a basis for accountability to perform the online function
(getting federal forms online within a time limit in this case) while providing
the implementers with sufficient flexibility to avail themselves of the
best options in a swiftly changing environment.

<P>The provisions of Section 7 of the Government Paperwork Elimination
Act would require federal standards setters to tailor technical requirements
for security and authentication to the actual needs of a given transaction.&nbsp;
This will save money on unnecessary levels of security and will align incentives
to use the right market-based solution for the particular transactional
challenge at hand.&nbsp; Naturally, every form will not have a special
process, but nor should every form be required to meet the same process.&nbsp;
Section 7 recognizes the need for some flexibility to match the technical
and business solutions to the forms to be filed.

<P>As the federal government begins the process of setting the technical
and business practice standards necessary to carry out this legislation,
I hope the appropriate officials and technicians will consider working
collaboratively with state governments working on the same issues.&nbsp;
Our systems at the state and federal levels are inter-related and in many
cases are inter-dependent.&nbsp; There are often corresponding state and
federal forms covering the same subject matter.&nbsp; From the point of
view of the citizen, we have a duty to coordinate our online presence at
least enough to avoid unnecessary burdens related to conflicting or inconsistent
approaches at our respective levels of government.

<P>The National Automated Clearinghouse has served as a promising forum
in which state, federal and private sector participants have already begun
to tackle some of the more subtle issues around digital signature and related
standards.&nbsp; The non-profit organization CommerceNet has been a very
important association in which the private sector has come forward to arrive
at technical and practical solutions that meet business and public policy
requirements for privacy and security.&nbsp; Both state and federal government
members participate along with innovative technology companies at CommerceNet
because public and private sector approaches must be coordinated.&nbsp;
In addition, the National Association of State Information Resource Executives,
the National Association of State Procurement Officers, and the National
Association of State Comptrollers have recently formed the Electronic Commerce
Coordinating Council (EC3) to promote information sharing and consistent
approaches regarding these issues at a state government level.&nbsp; The
EC3 has recently passed a resolution that encourages, among other things,
technology neutrality and market based solutions in electronic commerce
legislation at the state, federal and international levels of governance.&nbsp;
I will make available to the Committee a running list of such relevant
initiatives at <A HREF="http://www.tiac.net/biz/danielg">www.tiac.net/biz/danielg</A>
on the Internet.

<P>I hope you will not hesitate to ask if I can be of any assistance to
you as you continue to consider these important issues.&nbsp; On behalf
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I thank you for the opportunity to
participate in this important hearing and to contribute another perspective
for your consideration.&nbsp; Thank you.
<BR>&nbsp;
