<p>Mr. Chairman, members of the Subcommittee, on behalf of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, thank you for the opportunity to testify today on House Bill 1714, the
Electronic Signature in Global and National Commerce Act (E-SIGN). The Commonwealth is
home to many information age businesses and our state government is a robust user of
electronic commerce technologies. As such, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has had
significant experience with the legal and policy implications of electronic authentication
technologies. It has been the policy of the Commonwealth to promote the growth of our
emerging electronic commerce industry in a non-regulatory, market-driven fashion. </p>

<p>To the extent that H.R. 1714 facilitates creation of a national consistent legal
infrastructure supporting electronic commerce without unduly disrupting related areas of
state law, it deserves serious consideration and support. While the current language of
the bill contains certain provisions that would benefit from further honing, it seems
clear that the objectives of this legislation are wholly consistent with the
Commonwealth’s policy to assure a sound foundation for electronic commerce. Our
desire is to indicate the ways in which this bill can be helpful and to constructively
suggest some alternative formulations of certain sections for the purpose of achieving the
bill’s goals without causing harm to ongoing efforts at the state level to develop
more uniform electronic commerce law as part of the overall uniform state commercial legal
framework. </p>

<p>Last month, the Commonwealth went on record before the Senate in support of S. 761, by
Senator Abraham, which promotes a national legal base-line on certain issues related to
electronic commerce transaction contracts and usage of electronic signatures and records.
In an Issues Brief dated April 19, 1999, the National Governor’s Association
questioned the need for federal legislation, but characterized the Abraham bill as
follows: 

</p><dir>
  <dir>
    <p>"Despite the preemption contained in the Millennium Digital Commerce Act, the
    legislation is fairly friendly to states’ interests. The bill’s scope is
    carefully restricted to interstate commercial transactions, over which Congress has
    jurisdiction through the Commerce Clause. The drafters of the bill have made a concerted
    effort to avoid interfering with areas of state law that involve records and signatures
    that are unrelated to interstate commerce."&nbsp; [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070613033313/http://www.nga.org/Pubs/IssueBriefs/1999/990419FedDigitalSigs.asp">http://www.nga.org/Pubs/IssueBriefs/1999/990419FedDigitalSigs.asp</a>]</p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<p>It seems clear that the Abraham bill and H.R. 1714 have very similar goals and are on
corresponding tracks through each respective chamber. It is hoped that the final version
of H.R. 1714 is refined so as to avoid the problems associated with undue interference
with legitimate areas of state laws governing records, signatures and contracts. Assuming
that such amendments occur, then this bill would clearly meet the stated interests of
electronic commerce industry advocates who have voiced a desire for legal reforms to
provide greater certainty in the short term. </p>

<p><b>Background</b> </p>

<p>Conventional wisdom is evolving regarding the appropriate scope of legislative action
effecting electronic commerce. Despite a brief fad in the mid-1990s favoring a regulatory,
technology-specific approach to electronic commerce, the vast majority of state
governments have recently opted for a minimalist, non-regulatory and technology-neutral
stance. Unfortunately, certain foreign jurisdictions and international organizations seem
to be several years behind the United States and are currently adopting regulatory,
technology specific, and centralized policies regarding electronic commerce generally.
Fortunately, both H.R. 1714 and the Abraham bill reflect the U.S. preference favoring free
and competitive markets, rather than government intervention. </p>

<p>In 1995, Utah was the first jurisdiction in the world to enact "digital
signature" legislation. Reflecting the trends of the time, this law is regulatory (it
empowered a state agency to license providers); technology-specific (public key
cryptography); promotes a certain business model and implementation (trusted third parties
and digital certificates); increases e-commerce user liability (by limiting provider
liability); and reverses age-old evidentiary rules regarding proof of signatures (by
providing a presumption against the signature technology user). </p>

<p>The passage of time indicates that this approach went too far and created unintended
market distortions. In fact, it has not even been generally favored by the very industry
it was enacted to promote (virtually every major certificate provider has chosen not to
become licensed in the three states—Washington, Minnesota, and Utah--that attempted
to regulate their fledgling product or service sector. </p>

<p>Over the past few years, a broad convergence in activity and published policy has
evidenced a solid and growing consensus that government actions effecting electronic
commerce should generally be non-regulatory, technology neutral, support the rights of
parties to structure their business models and technical implementations through contracts
and agreements and should not tamper with rules of evidence and liability apportionment as
an industrial policy setting mechanism. </p>

<p>The last point, regarding tampering with rules of evidence, bears some additional
explanation. There have been proponents of legislation at the state and the federal level
which would create an evidentiary presumption against the user of an electronic signature.
The rationale was that receivers of electronically signed messages deserve special
government protection. This rationale fails to recognize that the proponent of such
evidence should be the party with the burden to prove that the signature occurred.
Likewise, the receiver of the signature is in the best position to judge the reliability
of the authentication in the context of the value of the transaction, and they are the
party most likely to have the relevant evidence that a signature was presented to them.
Again, both H.R. 1714 and the Abraham language reflects these time-honored legal
principles. </p>

<p>The application of these general principles to electronic commerce is swiftly gained
wide acceptance over the past few years. In the 1997 <i>Framework for Global Electronic
Commerce</i>, the Clinton Administration articulated principles supporting a
technology-neutral approach to electronic commerce, and opposing regulation. Likewise, in
1997, the Internet Law and Policy Forum drafted a set of principles that promoted a
thriving market and strongly resisted regulation (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070613033313/http://www.ilpf.org/digsig/principles.htm%29">http://www.ilpf.org/digsig/principles.htm)</a>.
And in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress expressly found that ``[t]he Internet
and other interactive computer services have flourished, to the benefit of all Americans,
with a minimum of government regulation'' and declared that ``[i]t is the policy of the
United States . . . to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently
exists for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or
State regulation.''&nbsp; The Commonwealth was pleased to work with Senator Abraham's
office and the office of Congresswoman Eshoo on the Government Paperwork Elimination Act
last session, which also largely embodied these principles.&nbsp; Over the past two years
innumerable additional such positions, statements and policies among states and the
federal government as well as from various private organizations.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>General Criteria for Legislation</b> </p>

<p>The success or failure of legislation governing e-commerce this session should be based
on the answers to five fundamental questions. </p>

<p><u>1. Is the legislation narrowly tailored to address existing and well understood
market failures?</u> </p>

<p>Another word for this is "minimalist" in other words, limited to address only
what is currently necessary and appropriate. The chances of "doing no harm" are
increased dramatically when government intervention in the private market is closely
restricted to fixing specific and demonstrated problems that the market and existing laws
have failed to address. This is especially true in the fast growing and dynamic area of
electronic commerce. Relatively small changes in law can have the effect of chilling
competition or otherwise distorting the free evolution of efficient solutions in the
quickly moving and difficult to predict e-commerce field. Specifically, legislation that
focuses on or includes provisions dealing with business or consumer rights or liabilities
connected with the use of a public key infrastructure or other particular technologies
that are not yet widely used may create harmful and unnecessary results. The actual
problems may well turn out to be different than the projected issues. </p>

<p><u>2. Does it promote a competitive marketplace for different technologies?</u> </p>

<p>Legislation should promote, rather than chill, competition. That means Congress should
avoid legislating a market winner. Another way to look at this criteria would be: "is
it technology-neutral or does it give a special legislative 'leg up' to a given
technology, business model or implementation available for general use in the
market?" It is unfortunately common that special interests that stand to benefit from
market intervention often lobby for such government action. In the case of electronic
commerce, however, it seems clear that the best government action with respect to
promotion and facilitation of that market is usually <i>no action at all</i>. By
enshrining a given technology in legislation, government action may have the
counter-effect of reducing incentives for further improvements and innovations. </p>

<p>Legislation can distort the technology markets by regulating the security or
reliability criteria that must be applied to create an electronic signature even if it
stops short of specifying the particular technology necessary. These types of criteria
usually include a requirement that the signature technology is under the "sole
control" of the signer and that it can detect or prevent any change to the signed
record. These particular implementations may be appropriate in some, perhaps many,
situations. However, the specific security features necessary and appropriate will differ
dramatically depending upon the transaction and the parties' needs. For example, a
"signature machine" (e.g. an institutional check signing mechanism) is clearly
not under the "sole control" of the signer. In fact, it is doubtful that a
treasurer, comptroller or CFO of an institution has any direct contact at all. The same is
true of non-check organizational authentication of many types. It is accessible to several
authorized individuals and there are internal controls and systemic security measures in
place. Similarly, many popular and adequately safe authentication implementations do not,
by themselves, detect or prevent alteration of underlying data. Most PIN and password
systems in use today in banking, healthcare, commerce and elsewhere do not possess this
specific feature. Nor do many biometric products. </p>

<p>Current implementations live or die based on buyers and users making cost, benefit and
risk judgements about the amount of reliability and types of security features needed.
Well-intentioned attempts by legislators to come up with a "one size fits all"
approach to signature technology features are doomed. The Uniform Electronic Transactions
Act at one time had such criteria, but based upon months of discussion it now reflects and
supports the common law definition of signature: any symbol executed with the intent to
sign. In narrow cases where legislation is dealing with specific user communities (like a
Securities context or a Consumer Protection issue) then it may be appropriate to specify
more specific requirements, but general legislation covering every economic and social
sector should never distort the competitive and open market for electronic signature and
records technologies. </p>

<p><u>3. Does it include any new or expanded regulation or other government intervention,
including legislatively created "accreditation" through government approval or
control over technology suppliers or users?</u> </p>

<p>It is increasingly obvious that the United States stands at the opening of a
substantively different economic and societal phase: some call it the information society.
The economic impacts are profound. Decentralized, self-organizing and distributed systems
are gaining dominance. Old industries built on intermediating relationships are
disappearing as the Internet and other technologies eliminate the barriers that created a
need for such middle-men. Fast changing, dynamic, and rapidly growing markets are evolving
before our eyes--in many cases, markets which are little understood. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, some advocates continue to promote industrial-era policy designed for
economic and social conditions of the last century. Industrial organizations were
inherently centralized and regulations were correspondingly focused at the "choke
points." Internet-mediated communications and new forms of relationships between
parties are often--and increasingly--organized differently. Centralization of market
participants for the sole purpose of making them easier to regulate for government is
wrong. And such a policy risks killing the goose to control its eggs. Requiring government
licensure of market suppliers or setting up so-called "self regulatory
organizations" (which in fact are under the thumb of federal or state regulators) is
antithetical to the new economy. Absent serious market failures, government should resist
erecting new oversight and control mechanisms over any part of electronic commerce. There
are, of course, a large number of existing statutes, regulations and legal doctrines that
create a floor of behavior to handle crime, fraud, and threats to national security. These
laws currently appear to be quite adequate to prevent known harms. </p>

<p>One useful policy approach is modeled in the draft report developed by the NACHA
Certificate Authority Ratings and Trust Task Force, which seek to give parties helpful
guidelines, including detailed policy and contractual terms, to assist in the creation of
legally enforceable and reliable implementation of authentication technology (background
information at: www.state.ma.us/itd/legal). This is an example of a "bottom up"
approach rather than an approach that favors central policy making or regulatory
oversight. Legislation should simply lift legal barriers and thereby allow parties to use
existing bodies of law, such as contract law, to tailor their transactions to their own
needs. Ultimately, as national standards and practices emerge, they will be based upon
actual proven market experience and they will be far better than any scheme anyone can
dream up today through central planning. The current draft 1.0 of the NACHA CARAT
Guidelines is available at: <font size="-1"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070613033313/http://internetcouncil.nacha.org/CARAT/CARAT921.DOC">http://internetcouncil.nacha.org/CARAT/CARAT921.DOC</a></font>
on the web. A ginchy example of contractually based Operating Rules that are consistent
with the CARAT Guidelines can be found at <font size="-1"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070613033313/http://www.emall.isa.us/">http://www.emall.isa.us/</a></font> (a multistate
electronic commerce procurement project to buy goods over the web from several private
vendors). </p>

<p><u>4. Does the legislation disrupt other bodies of law or unduly preempt state
jurisdiction over commercial law?</u> </p>

<p>There are compelling arguments in favor of generally keeping governance of commerce
under state jurisdiction, provided the law is sufficiently harmonized so as not to present
an undue barrier to interstate commerce. States are far more agile than the federal
government in responding quickly to changing market conditions. As such, states serve as
important laboratories of innovation in the realm of public policy and law. </p>

<p>The arguments are particularly strong for continuing state primacy in the context of
electronic signatures, records and contracts, because a signature or a record requirement
arises under innumerable other areas of state law. A single federal law that purported to
grant legal equivalency for electronic signatures, for example, would almost certainly
have the effect of creating significant disruptions in areas of state law that have
nothing to do with commerce, such as wills, trusts, powers of attorney, consumer
protections, real estate deeds, negotiable instruments, notice requirements, elections
law, hospital regulation, and state criminal justice laws.&nbsp; Massachusetts, for
example, has some 4,515 different sections of law that relate to a signing or writing.
&nbsp; (<i>See:</i> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070613033313/http://www.state.ma.us/itd/legal/siglaw4.doc">http://www.state.ma.us/itd/legal/siglaw4.doc</a>
)</p>

<p>However, in some cases, the needs of the nation require that federal action preempt
state law. This has been long accepted where states create undue impediments to interstate
commerce. The fact that states have adopted such a dizzying array of different laws
dealing with electronic signatures and records has been a major contributor to the current
efforts for federal action. If states quickly pass uniform law in this area, it is likely
that legitimate private sector interests in a national baseline will be satisfied through
uniform state law. This is the preferred method of creating the base-line because the
draft Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) clearly represents the single best, most
comprehensive, well principled legislative effort to date and, importantly, it causes few
or no serious legal disruptions or other harm because it is finely integrated with other
areas of law. No federal law yet proposed (or likely to emerge) can claim the same
features – in part because the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State
Law has sponsored a multi-year deliberative process in which interested parties from the
public and private sectors have collaborated in open forums to work through these complex
and subtle issues. However, to the extent that commercial interests make a convincing case
that faster action is needed than can be accommodated via the uniform law process, then
the Commonwealth has already gone on record as supporting narrow and temporary federal
"bridge" legislation to produce the necessary legal national base-line. </p>

<p>The key criteria for any such bridge legislation is that it must be narrowly tailored
to address only those matters upon which immediate action is needed (as distinct from
matters that can wait for uniform state law) and that it provide a statutory mechanism
that reverts jurisdiction back to the states upon adoption of a consistent base-line legal
framework. Since the UETA appears poised to shepherd in such a framework, any federal law
in this arena should recognize and promote this uniform law effort. </p>

<p><u>5. Does the legislation give an undue competitive advantage in this new market to a
single industry or economic sector over participants of other economic sectors?</u> </p>

<p>Legislation should not grant any particular sector a special leg up by government. If
legislation lifts general legal barriers or solves general problems for only a specific
sector of the economy, then an undue competitive advantage may result in unfortunate
market distortions. Promoting competition among different sectors in this area is good
because many of the problems are far from being solved, and each sector bring its own
resources, expertise and approaches to the solutions. Legislation granting special
presumptions or validity upon electronic authentication when it is supplied only by
vendors in a single market (say, by telecom companies, or network service providers, or
licensed attorneys, or even financial institutions alone) runs the risk of ultimately
harming, rather than promoting, optimal technical and business-model solutions that would
arise from highly competitive marketplace interactions. </p>

<p><b>Summary and Conclusion</b> </p>

<p>In summary, the apparent goals of H.R. 1714 are worthy of support. Private sector
representatives have made a strong case before the House and Senate that some action is
needed in the shorter term. The objectives of this legislation are evidently to satisfy
these legitimate interests of industry without unduly harming related areas of state law.
Review of the bill based upon the five question asked above indicates that this
legislation, with some modifications, can directly satisfy key principles for electronic
commerce legislation. </p>

<p>I request the privilege to add an addendum to these written remarks within the next 30
days which will provide more detailed comments on the precise provisions of the current
legislative language as they relate to state law and to suggest possible alternative
formulations. We anticipate these comments will focus largely on limiting the scope of
Title I to contracts effectuating interstate commerce transactions (as opposed to
including all agreements that may affect interstate commerce); assuring that the operative
provisions of the law merely accord legal status upon electronic transactions that is
equivalent to what those transactions would receive if they were carried out via other
media (as opposed to granting whole new categories of rights and responsibilities only for
electronic transactions); assuring that the formula for states to retrieve jurisdiction
under the overall framework of existing commercial law is clear and promotes enactment of
the UETA or an equivalent uniform law; minimizing or eliminating federal administrative
oversight over state government affairs; and conforming definitions of electronic
signatures and other key terms to existing and emerging bodies of law governing electronic
transactions. </p>

<p>Please do not hesitate to call upon my office as a supportive resource as this
legislation continues to evolve. It is my sincere hope that we can assist you as you seek
to hone some of the provisions of this bill to conform more closely to the principles set
out above. Again, thank you for the chance to share our views today. </p>
