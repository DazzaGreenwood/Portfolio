Before The U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Banking and Financial Services<br>
Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit<br><p>
September 18, 1997</p></center></h3>
<p><br></p><p>


<font size="3"></font></p><p><font size="3">Chairwoman Roukema, and
members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to participate
in this important hearing on consumer privacy issues related to online
financial transactions. I am appearing today in my capacity as Deputy
General Counsel for the Commonwealth�s Information Technology Division.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has been a leading state in the area
of electronic commerce policy as well as consumer protection laws. The
Commonwealth has a strong state banking system and a solid history of
working constructively with our federal partners to promote the
interests of commerce and consumers alike. We view these hearings as
another positive forum in which to discuss how states and the federal
government can work collaboratively to address emerging issues related
to the growing electronic commerce marketplace. </font></p>
<font size="3"> 
<b><p>The Electronic Commerce Context</p>
</b> 
</font><p><font size="3">It is useful to consider issues of financial
privacy of electronic data in a broader context of electronic commerce.
Online banking and financial services will be increasingly important as
more economic sectors engage in the online purchase and sale of goods,
services and information. The Commonwealth is home to a number of
leading edge electronic commerce companies that provide needed
communications, network security and applications tools for electronic
commerce businesses. Furthermore, the Commonwealth is a leading state
in the use of electronic commerce to cut costs and enhance service
quality for citizens and businesses that interact with our state
government. For example, today citizens can renew vehicle registration,
pay a traffic citation and even order a vanity license plate over the
Commonwealth�s web site with a standard web browser and a credit card.
We encrypt the credit card data over the Internet for security. Banks
and other financial institutions are now participating in a pilot with
the Commonwealth�s Division of Banks that enables filings to the
division over the Internet and uses digital certificates (based on
public key cryptography) to encrypt the data and to authenticate the
parties. Similarly, vendors seeking to bid on public works can now find
the Commonwealth�s solicitations available on the World Wide Web. We
believe the citizens would rather be online than in line.</font></p>
<font size="3"> 
</font><p><font size="3">There is wide agreement that electronic
commerce and payment applications offer the opportunity for more cost
efficient, easier to use and, in some cases, qualitatively superior
business methods than would be possible without online media and
communications technology. In the areas of health care, education,
government transactions, software licenses, retail sales and many other
areas, electronic commerce and payment methods are seen as important
tools to improve not only the way people work, but the work itself.
While the creation, storage and transmission of data in electronic form
rather than on paper gives rise to new opportunities for commerce and
society, new threats are posed to privacy as well. Privacy and consumer
protection issues can create obstacles that are every bit as real as
lack of electricity. If users do not trust and use these systems, then
the proverbial plug is pulled from electronic commerce. </font></p>
<font size="3"> 
</font><p><font size="3">The general message I would like to deliver
today is that online transactions and electronic commerce raise a large
number of legal and policy issues that cut across traditional legal,
geographic and economic boundaries. Therefor, there is a pronounced
need for consultation, coordination and cooperation among all levels of
government as we set policy for the information age. In the most
literal sense, electronic commerce is multi-jurisdictional by its very
nature. It is not always possible to know reliably precisely who one is
dealing with or where they are situated during an online transaction
over an open network such as the Internet. Internet traffic can
originate or terminate anywhere and go everywhere in between. </font></p>
<font size="3"> 
<b><p>The Relationship Between the States and the Federal Government</p>
</b> 
</font><p><font size="3">Many issue areas are squarely matters of
traditional state jurisprudence. For example, to the extent online
transactions are conducted by electronic contracts, then contract law
will doubtless be looked to as disputes arise. Areas such as contract
law, general commercial law, and state rules of evidence should remain
as state jurisprudence. There are 239 separate sections of the
Massachusetts General Laws dealing with various aspects of privacy or
confidentiality of information. Many of these laws (not unlike laws of
other states) express the unique policy judgements of our jurisdiction
and are not reflected in federal law. Naturally, privacy issues
implicate both state and federal law. Federal preemption, as a policy
theme is neither desirable nor appropriate. As both federal and state
law evolves, we must work to form a consistent national legal
infrastructure in support of the emerging information society. </font></p>
<font size="3"> 
</font><p><font size="3">The Commonwealth has generally favored a
"pro-market" policy toward electronic commerce. For example, in the
area of electronic signature legislation, we are drafting a bill that
would provide legal validity for electronic signatures, but would not
create any new regulatory oversight or requirements. This mirrors the
current trend in electronic commerce legislation being enacted and
considered at the state level. The National Conference of Commissioners
on Uniform State Law (NCCUSL) is also in the process of drafting
uniform law in the related areas of electronic contracts and licenses.
The NCCUSL draft uniform Electronic Transactions Act is non-regulatory
in nature. It is instructive to note that the recent White House
"Framework for Global Electronic Commerce" also appears to favor a
non-regulatory approach toward policy in this area. Specifically, the
Framework endorses industry self-regulation in the areas of privacy and
electronic payment systems. I do not presume to speak on Federal
policy, but it does seem that a national consensus is emerging in favor
of a non-regulatory approach toward electronic commerce. This approach
promotes growth, investment and innovation for better technical and
business models.</font></p>
<font size="3"> 
<b><p>The Role of the States in Electronic Banking and Financial Services Policy</p>
</b> 
</font><p><font size="3">The Commonwealth has a long history as a
leader in legislation and policy fostering banking innovations and
consumer credit protections. A number of the Commonwealth�s laws on
these subjects have been used as models for federal acts and laws of
other states. Massachusetts enacted the first Truth in Lending law, the
first Credit Union law, and the first Savings Bank law.</font></p>
<font size="3"> 
</font><p><font size="3">In recognition of our leadership position in
the public interest, the federal government has specifically removed
areas of Massachusetts�s law from the scope of otherwise preemptive
federal law. For example, the Federal Reserve Board determined that
Massachusetts�s law on electronic funds transfers would not be
preempted by the federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation
E. With respect to Section 54A(a) of Chapter 93 of the Massachusetts
Annotated Laws (as in effect on the date of enactment of the Consumer
Credit Reporting Reform Act of 1996), the United States Congress also
specifically excepted preemption by the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
Massachusetts has a strong state banking system, with 333 state
chartered banks and other financial institutions as of August 30<sup>th</sup>
of this year. The Commonwealth seeks to continue the state/federal
partnership represented by our nation�s duel banking system and we
would oppose measures that weaken the state component of that system. </font></p>
<font size="3"> 
</font><p><font size="3">The Commonwealth agrees with the following
selections of "Principles for the Evolving Financial Services Industry"
as incorporated in policy by the National Governor�s Association:</font></p>
<font size="3"> </font><dir>

<p><font size="3">As Congress and the administration consider
regulatory and statutory changes affecting the financial services
industry, the Governors urge them to respect the following principles.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"> </font></p>
<p><font size="3">� Government�s role is not to direct financial
services restructuring, but rather to ensure that access to capital and
modern financial services at reasonable prices are available throughout
the nation. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">�  Federally chartered institutions must not have a competitive advantage over state-chartered financial institutions.  </font></p>
<p><font size="3">� Boards established by federal law and regulation
that set policy affecting state financial institutions should include
representatives of state regulatory agencies as members. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">� Changes in federal law or regulations issued by
federal agencies should not result in a situation in which states may
no longer act as laboratories for public policy through either the dual
banking system or the complementary system of securities regulation.
Innovation at the state level should be encouraged, as it promotes
investor confidence, benefits consumers, reduces systemic risk, and
maintains the safety and soundness of financial institutions. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">� States bear primary responsibility for enforcing
laws regarding consumer protection, individual investor protection,
community reinvestment, and fair credit. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">� The charterer of national banks cannot be given
oversight of state-chartered banks or the result will be a bias toward
national bank requests and issues.</font></p>
<font size="3"> 
</font><p><font size="3">The Governors call on Congress and the
administration to consult with the nation�s Governors concerning the
impact on states and consumers of any federal legislative proposals
regarding the evolving financial services industry.</font></p>
<font size="3"> </font></dir>

<p><font size="3">The Office of Consumer Affairs for the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts in conjunction with the Commonwealth�s Division of
Banks is now compiling information to examine consumer issues in
relation to online and cyber-banking. Clearly, policies in this area
will have to balance the need to promote economic activity in this
fledgling field against basic consumer protections. </font></p>
<font size="3"> 
<b><p>Forums for Communication, Consultation and Coordination</p>
</b> 
</font><p><font size="3">As the Commonwealth and other states work to
strike the appropriate balances for our jurisdictions, we would echo
the call of the Governors that Congress and the administration actively
consult with the states in these matters of mutual concern. The
National Governors� Association, the secretary of commerce, and the
White House science advisor established the United States Innovation
Partnership (USIP) to assist in the coordination of national technology
policy at the federal and state levels. The Commonwealth of
Massachusetts is a member of the USIP and we have found this
organization to be a useful forum to address a wide range of issues,
including various electronic commerce topics at coordinated state and
federal levels.</font></p>
<font size="3"> 
</font><p><font size="3">The National Conference of Commissioners on
Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) has established a Committee on Liaison with
the Federal Government. In the past, when Congress has perceived a need
for uniform national treatment of a legal area, NCCUSL has been called
on to act by Congress. For example, in 1994, Congress enacted the Money
Laundering Suppression Act which specifically requested that the states
should develop a uniform "NDP" act under the auspices of NCCUSL or the
American Law Institute. The Commonwealth has been active with the
drafting of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act and we will be
represented at the NCCUSL drafting meeting in Arlington, VA this
weekend.</font></p>
<font size="3"> 
</font><p><font size="3">The American Bar Association (ABA),
Information Security Committee has done considerable work on electronic
commerce legal issues. This committee focuses on the area of Public Key
Infrastructures (PKI). The Commonwealth participates in the Legislative
and Regulatory Work Group of that committee. The Work Group recently
published a statement titled: "States' Role in Developing Digital
Signatures Policies and Standards." Available at </font><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070206092901/http://www.abanet.org/scitech/ec/isc/stateds.html"><font size="3">http://www.abanet.org/scitech/ec/isc/stateds.html</font></a><font size="3">,
the statement sets forth background on state government activities in
the PKI field and suggests that the recent zeal for federal preemption
of state law in the area of electronic signature legislation should be
relaxed. The ABA Business Law Section�s Committee on the Law of
Commerce in Cyberspace has offered a good forum for thinking on
regulatory barriers to electronic commerce and has provided solid input
to law and policy makers. The Commonwealth is conducting an empirical
survey of electronic contracting practices and we are pleased that this
committee will join our group of co-sponsors. The ABA offers another
forum for communication between the public and private sectors on
electronic commerce and payment issues.</font></p>
<font size="3"> 
</font><p><font size="3">From a legal and policy point of view, issues
of online privacy often boil down to disclosure and notice. For
example, sensible minds may differ as to when a party to an online
transaction should have a "reasonable expectation of privacy." Netscape
has implemented an icon of a broken key when Internet communications
are unencrypted and the icon becomes a solid key when the browser
engages a "secure" session with a web server. This image provides a
simple symbol for online users to comprehend the current state of their
data confidentiality as the data moves over a network (including the
Internet). Developing widely understood symbols that convey reliable
information about the security and practices of an online environment
will be another way to convey important information to consumers. The
Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology have partnered this semester to conduct a graduate level
course exploring these issues. The course is taught at the MIT School
of Architecture and Planning and examines legal, policy, design and
technical issues related to building virtual communities where online
users can interact with each other, their environment and with their
government. The course specifically explores how to apply data modeling
and user interface designs to create meaningful and useful symbols for
privacy, authentication, place, jurisdiction and other critical factors
for online transactions. More information on this course is available
at </font><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070206092901/http://sap.mit.edu/ap/sapdean/wjm_vsh.htm"><font size="3">http://sap.mit.edu/ap/sapdean/wjm_vsh.htm</font></a><font size="3">.  </font></p>
<font size="3"> 
<b><p>Conclusion</p>
</b> 
</font><p><font size="3">In closing, the Commonwealth favors working
with other levels of government, academia and the private sector to
craft electronic commerce and payment policy that works for our
jurisdiction and fits in the national structure. We believe we have
some valuable contributions to offer and we are certain we have a lot
to learn by collaboration in this exciting field. Please do not
hesitate to contact us if we can be of assistance to the Subcommittee.
I thank you for the opportunity to testify at this hearing.</font></p>
