<p><b><font size="+1">Background and Overview</font></b></p></center>

<p>On March 25, Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI), introduced the first significant
legislation of this Congress on the commercial use of electronic signatures
and electronic contracts. The "Millenium Digital Commerce Act," S. 761,
builds on the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (cite), also sponsored
by Senator Abraham, which was enacted last year to clear certain legal
obstacles and to set deadlines for the federal government to accept electronically
signed forms over the Internet. Although no federal legislation has yet
been enacted that would affect commercial, rather than federal, transactions,
over 40 states have enacted notably different laws in this general domain.
In fact, the existence of non-uniform state legislation has been one of
the driving factors behind federal legislative action.
</p><p>It looks increasingly likely that legislation will be enacted in this
Congress dealing with electronic commercial transactions between two or
more private parties. While Federal legislators are still in need of gathering
general more information, they appear willing to act in some way now. With
this in mind, the Abraham bill stands a good chance of passing the Senate--it
is timely, narrowly focused, relatively uncontroversial, and balances the
competing interests of affected parties. Already, it boasts strong bipartisan
support from important congressional leaders, including Majority Leader
Trent Lott. In addition, significant business interests, including Gateway,
Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, the ITAA, and the National Association of Manufacturers
supports it; others are expected to sign onto the legislation shortly.
And given the care with which this bill interacts with areas of state law,
it is likely to avoid the severe political difficulties associated with
strong opposition by governors and state governments and the criticism
of commercial law experts. In fact, at least some state support for the
Abraham measure is expected and there will be representation from supportive
state interests at the upcoming hearing on this bill.
</p><p>In the House of Representatives two bills also addressing electronic
signatures and records were filed on May 6, H.R. 1714 and H.R. 1685 by
House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley and by Congressman Boucher
respectively. There is much in the Bliley bill to be commended, but there
are also some issues that remain to be worked through. Given proper amendments,
this session of Congress may actually see state support behind the final
versions of both a House and Senate bill on electronic commerce, despite
mild preemption. Like the Abraham bill, both House bills attempt to be
non-regulatory and technology-neutral. This is very good. Unlike the Abraham
legislation, however, these bills are expected to be more controversial
in part because they conflict with the common law and emerging uniform
law on the definition of a signature and an electronic signatures. Even
more importantly, these measures would cause disruption in related areas
of commercial and other law at the state level based on the imposition
of non-standard federal rules over a single part of transactions that are
otherwise covered by state law. No basis for these discrepancies are enumerated
within those bills, though the Bliley bill makes a good beginning at solving
some of the problems by excepting out testamentary and family law and by
creating some room to allow more exceptions. Given the imminent advent
of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, providing a comprehensive and
sound legal framework for the entirety of electronic transactions, the
House measures in present form seem to be more disruptive than needed to
achieve the goals desired. To the credit of Tom Bliley, his office has
stated a willingness to work through amendments and receive broader input
to further evolve the legislation. In any case, the Abraham bill appears
poised to pass the Senate and there is now a greater likelihood that the
House will act as well, indicating a real possibility that legislation
on electronic signatures could be finalized before the 106<sup>th</sup>
Congress adjourns late next year.
</p><center>
<p><b><font size="+1">Background of Electronic Authentication and Commerce
Statutes</font></b></p></center>

<p>Conventional wisdom is evolving regarding the appropriate scope of legislative
action effecting electronic commerce. Despite a brief fad in the mid-1990s
favoring a regulatory, technology-specific approach to electronic commerce,
the vast majority of state governments have recently opted for a minimalist,
non-regulatory and technology-neutral stance. Unfortunately, certain foreign
jurisdictions and international organizations seem to be several years
behind the United States and are currently adopting regulatory, technology
specific, and centralized policies regarding electronic commerce generally.
Fortunately, the Abraham bill reflects the U.S. preference favoring free
and competitive markets, rather than government intervention.
</p><p>In 1995, Utah was the first jurisdiction in the world to enact "digital
signature" legislation. Reflecting the trends of the time, this law is
regulatory (it empowered a state agency to license providers); technology-specific
(public key cryptography); promotes a certain business model and implementation
(trusted third parties and digital certificates); increases commercial
liability (by limiting provider liability); and reverses age-old evidentiary
rules regarding proof of signatures (by providing a presumption against
the signature technology user).
</p><p>The passage of time indicates that this approach went too far and created
unintended market distortions. In fact, it has not even been generally
favored by the very industry it was enacted to promote (virtually every
major certificate provider has chosen not to become licensed in the three
states�Washington, Minnesota, and Utah--that attempted to regulate their
fledgling product or service sector.
</p><p>The Abraham bill takes a different tack, comporting with state common
law and the proposed Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). These
require that the intent to electronically sign must be based upon the surrounding
circumstances and context, including consideration of common practices,
trade usage, and the reasonable expectations of the parties. A contract
or agreement between parties that describes the liability for a signature
or when a signature is attributable to a party in a complex automated transaction
would be an example of relevant context. Regardless, it is sound policy
for the proponent of evidence to prove that the signature occurred. Likewise,
the receiver of the signature is in the best position to judge the reliability
of the authentication in the context of the value of the transaction, and
they are the party most likely to have the relevant evidence that a signature
was presented to them. The Abraham language reflects these time-honored
legal principles.
</p><p>The application of these general principles to electronic commerce is
gradually gaining wider acceptance. In the 1997 <i>Framework for Global
Electronic Commerce</i>, the Clinton Administration, articulated principles
supporting a technology-neutral approach to electronic commerce, and opposing
regulation. Likewise, in 1997, the Internet Law and Policy Forum drafted
a set of principles that promoted a thriving market and strongly resisted
regulation (see: <font size="-1"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070806102844/http://www.ilpf.org/digsig/principles.htm%29">http://www.ilpf.org/digsig/principles.htm)</a>.
And in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress expressly found that
``[t]he Internet and other interactive computer services have flourished,
to the benefit of all Americans, with a minimum of government regulation''
and declared that ``[i]t is the policy of the United States . . . to preserve
the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet
and other interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State
regulation.''</font>
</p><center>
<p><b><font size="+1">Five Questions to Determine the Success of Federal
Legislation This Session</font></b></p></center>

<p><font size="-1">As the electronic marketplace evolves and the understanding
of policy makers grows, the consensus on appropriate public policy has
developed accordingly. Based on close observation of the public positions
of industry leaders, lawmakers, and state and federal government officials,
the success or failure of legislation this session will be based on the
answers to five fundamental questions.</font>
</p><p><b><font size="-1">1. Is the legislation narrowly tailored to address
existing and well understood market failures?</font></b>
<br><b><font size="-1">The right answer is: Yes.</font></b>
</p><p><font size="-1">Another word for this is "minimalist" in other words,
limited to address only what is currently necessary and appropriate. The
chances of "doing no harm" are increased dramatically when government intervention
in the private market is closely restricted to fixing specific and demonstrated
problems that the market and existing laws have failed to address. This
is especially true in the fast growing and dynamic area of electronic commerce.
Relatively small changes in law can have the effect of chilling competition
or otherwise distorting the free evolution of efficient solutions in the
quickly moving and difficult to predict e-commerce field. Specifically,
legislation that focuses on or includes provisions dealing with business
or consumer rights or liabilities connected with the use of a public key
infrastructure or other particular technologies that are not yet widely
used may create harmful and unnecessary results. The actual problems may
well turn out to be different than the projected issues.</font>
</p><p><b><font size="-1">2. Does it promote a competitive marketplace for different
technologies?</font></b>
<br><b><font size="-1">The right answer is: Yes.</font></b>
</p><p><font size="-1">Legislation should promote, rather than chill, competition.
That means Congress should avoid legislating a market winner. Another way
to look at this criteria would be: "is it technology-neutral or does it
give a special legislative 'leg up' to a given technology, business model
or implementation available for general use in the market?" It is unfortunately
common that special interests that stand to benefit from market intervention
often lobby for such government action. In the case of electronic commerce,
however, it seems clear that the best government action with respect to
promotion and facilitation of that market is usually <i>no action at all</i>.
By enshrining a given technology in legislation, government action may
have the counter-effect of reducing incentives for further improvements
and innovations.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">Legislation can distort the technology markets by regulating
the security or reliability criteria that must be applied to create an
electronic signature even if it stops short of specifying the particular
technology necessary. These types of criteria usually include a requirement
that the signature technology is under the "sole control" of the signer
and that it can detect or prevent any change to the signed record. These
particular implementations may be appropriate in some, perhaps many, situations.
However, the specific security features necessary and appropriate will
differ dramatically depending upon the transaction and the parties needs.
For example, a "signature machine" (e.g. an institutional check signing
mechanism) is clearly not under the "sole control" of the signer. In fact,
it is doubtful that a treasurer, comptroller or CFO of an institution has
any direct contact at all. The same is true of non-check organizational
authentication of many types. It is accessible to several authorized individuals
and there are internal controls and systemic security measures in place.
Similarly, many popular and adequately safe authentication implementations
do not, by themselves, detect or prevent alteration of underlying data.
Most PIN and password systems in use today in banking, healthcare, commerce
and elsewhere do not possess this specific feature. Nor do many biometric
products.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">Current implementations live or die based on buyers and
users making cost, benefit and risk judgements about the amount of reliability
and types of security features needed. Well-intentioned attempts by legislators
to come up with a "one size fits all" approach to signature technology
features are doomed. The Uniform Electronic Transactions Act at one time
had such criteria, but based upon months of discussion it now reflects
and supports the common law definition of signature: any symbol executed
with the intent to sign. In narrow cases where legislation is dealing with
specific user communities (like a Securities context or a Consumer Protection
issue) then it may be appropriate to specify more specific requirements,
but general legislation covering every economic and social sector should
never distort the competitive and open market for electronic signature
and records technologies.</font>
</p><p><b><font size="-1">3. Does it include any new or expanded regulation or
other government intervention, including legislatively created "accreditation"
through government approval or control over technology suppliers or users?</font></b>
<br><b><font size="-1">The right answer is: No.</font></b>
</p><p><font size="-1">It is increasingly obvious that the United States stands
at the opening of a substantively different economic and societal phase:
some call it the information society. The economic impacts are profound.
Decentralized, self-organizing and distributed systems are gaining dominance.
Old industries built on intermediating relationships are disappearing as
the Internet and other technologies eliminate the barriers that created
a need for such middle-men. Fast changing, dynamic, and rapidly growing
markets are evolving before our eyes--in many cases, markets which are
little understood.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">It is at once amusing and tragic that some advocates continue
to promote industrial-era policy designed for economic and social conditions
of the last century. Industrial organizations were inherently centralized
and regulations were correspondingly focused at the "choke points." Internet-mediated
communications and new forms of relationships between parties are often--and
increasingly--organized differently. Centralization of market participants
for the sole purpose of making them easier to regulate for government is
wrong. And such a policy risks killing the goose to control its eggs. Requiring
government licensure of market suppliers or setting up so-called "self
regulatory organizations" (which in fact are under the thumb of federal
or state regulators) is antithetical to the new economy. Absent serious
market failures, government should resist erecting new oversight and control
mechanisms over any part of electronic commerce. There are, of course,
a large number of existing statutes, regulations and legal doctrines that
create a floor of behavior to handle crime, fraud, and threats to national
security. These laws currently appear to be quite adequate to prevent known
harms.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">One useful policy approach is modeled in the draft guidelines
being developed by the NACHA Certificate Authority Ratings and Trust Task
Force, which seek to give parties helpful considerations, including detailed
policy and contractual terms, to assist in the creation of legally enforceable
and reliable implementation of authentication technology (background information
at: www.state.ma.us/itd/legal). This type of "bottom up" approach is envisioned
in the Abraham legislation. Legislation should simply lifts legal barriers
allows parties to use existing bodies of law, such as contract law, to
tailor their transactions to their own needs. Ultimately, as national standards
and practices emerge, they will be based upon actual proven market experience
and they will be far better than any scheme anyone can dream up today through
central planning.</font>
</p><p><b><font size="-1">4. Does the legislation disrupt other bodies of law
or unduly preempt state jurisdiction over commercial law?</font></b>
<br><b><font size="-1">The right answer is: No.</font></b>
</p><p><font size="-1">There are compelling arguments in favor of generally keeping
governance of commerce under state jurisdiction, provided the law is sufficiently
harmonized so as not to present an undue barrier to interstate commerce.
States are far more agile than the federal government in responding quickly
to changing market conditions. As such, states serve as important laboratories
of innovation in the realm of public policy and law.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">The arguments are particularly strong for continuing state
primacy in the context of electronic signatures, records and contracts,
because a signature or a record requirement arises under innumerable other
areas of state law. A single federal law that purported to grant legal
equivalency for electronic signatures, for example, would almost certainly
have the effect of creating significant disruptions in areas of state law
that have nothing to do with commerce, such as wills, trusts, powers of
attorney, consumer protections, real estate deeds, negotiable instruments,
notice requirements, elections law, hospital regulation, and state criminal
justice laws. (Massachusetts, for example, has some 4,515 different sections
of law that relate to a signing or writing (<i>see:</i> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070806102844/http://www.state.ma.us/itd/legal/siglaw4.doc">http://www.state.ma.us/itd/legal/siglaw4.doc</a>
). )</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">However, in some cases, the needs of the nation require
that federal action preempt state law. This has been long accepted where
states create undue impediments to interstate commerce. The fact that states
have adopted such a dizzying array of different laws dealing with electronic
signatures and records has been a major contributor to the current efforts
for federal action. If states had been more cognizant of market approaches
and the problems with patchworks of law in this multi-jurisdictional transaction
flows of electronic commerce, it is unlikely that the current political
climate would support federal preemption in this area. If states quickly
pass uniform law in this area, it is likely that legitimate private sector
interests in a national baseline will cease agitating for broadly preemptive
federal law.</font>
</p><p><b><font size="-1">5. Does the legislation give an undue competitive advantage
in this new market to a single industry or economic sector over participants
of other economic sectors?</font></b>
<br><b><font size="-1">The right answer is: No.</font></b>
</p><p><font size="-1">Legislation should not grant any particular sector a special
leg up by government. If legislation lifts general legal barriers or solves
general problems for only a specific sector of the economy, then an undue
competitive advantage may result in unfortunate market distortions. Promoting
competition among different sectors in this area is good because many of
the problems are far from being solved, and each sector bring its own resources,
expertise and approaches to the solutions. Legislation granting special
presumptions or validity upon electronic authentication when it is supplied
only by vendors in a single market (say, by telecom companies, or network
service providers, or licensed attorneys, or even financial institutions
alone) runs the risk of ultimately harming, rather than promoting, optimal
technical and business-model solutions that would arise from highly competitive
marketplace interactions.</font>

<p><b><font size="+1">Section-by-Section Analysis of the Abraham Bill</font></b></p></center>

<p><b><i><font size="-1">The Congressional Findings (Section 2)</font></i></b>
</p><p><font size="-1">Congressional findings are used to explain the reasoning
behind the bill and to provide information on the factual and other circumstances
surrounding the legislation, including various factors that lead to the
need for the bill.&nbsp; The Abraham bill finds that (paraphrased and condensed):</font>
</p><ul>
<li>
<font size="-1">Congress believes electronic commerce is an important economic
driver for the country and that government action effecting electronic
commerce should embody a minimalist, technology neutral, non-regulatory,
and market-based approach.</font></li>

<li>
<font size="-1">States should continue to take the lead on setting innovative
technology policies, but should take care not to set individual policies
that differ so significantly that they create undue problems for interstate
commerce.</font></li>

<li>
<font size="-1">Congress has the responsibility to assure the healthy flow
of interstate commerce. To the extent that states create unreasonable impediments
to interstate electronic commerce through inconsistent or conflicting judicial
or legislative actions, it is appropriate for federal law to create a national
baseline.</font></li>

<li>
<font size="-1">Congress recognizes that complex and numerous areas of state
laws can be effected by federal action in this field, and that each state
jurisdiction must be counted upon to address the specific exceptions to
the scope of such a law, provided that those exceptions do not themselves
create an undue barrier to interstate electronic commerce.</font></li>

<li>
<font size="-1">There is a healthy, fast evolving market for various electronic
signature or authentication technologies and business models. For that
reason, law and formal government policies should continue to be generally
technology-neutral.</font></li>
</ul>
<b><i><font size="-1">The Purposes of the Bill (Section 3)</font></i></b>
<p><font size="-1">Here the Abraham bill again attempts to strike a balance
between a need for uniformity and the desire for lawmaking to remain within
existing areas of jurisdiction. It aims to:</font>
</p><ul>
<li>
<font size="-1">Permit and encourage the continued expansion of electronic
commerce through the operation of free market forces rather than proscriptive
governmental mandates and regulations;</font></li>

<li>
<font size="-1">Promote public confidence in the validity, integrity and
reliability of electronic commerce and online government under Federal
law;</font></li>

<li>
<font size="-1">Facilitate and promote electronic commerce by clarifying
the legal status of electronic records and electronic signatures in the
context of writing and signing requirements imposed by law;</font></li>

<li>
<font size="-1">Facilitate the ability of private parties engaged in interstate
transactions to agree among themselves on the terms and conditions on which
they use and accept electronic signatures and electronic records; and</font></li>

<li>
<font size="-1">Promote the development of a consistent national legal infrastructure
necessary to support of electronic commerce at the Federal and state levels
within existing areas of jurisdiction.</font></li>
</ul>
<b><i><font size="-1">Key Definitions (Section 4)</font></i></b>
<p><font size="-1">The definitions of S. 761 were drafted with the intent
to match as closely as possible those found in the Uniform Electronic Transactions
Act, now being developed by the National Conference of Commissioners on
Uniform State Law. As changes are made to the definitions in the UETA draft,
it is expected that the Abraham bill will be amended accordingly.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">In some cases, the definitions vary intentionally�for
example, the word "transaction." While this may appear to cut against the
goal of harmonized state and federal laws, in this case, there are compelling
reasons for the difference. The definition of a transaction under the proposed
UETA is purposely broad because it applies to general state electronic
signatures, records, and contract law, and as such would include nearly
every usage of electronic signatures, well beyond the realm of commerce.
In contrast, definition of "transaction" in the Abraham bill includes only
commercial interstate transactions, further assuring that its application
is strictly limited to areas of clear federal jurisdiction (under the Commerce
Clause of the U.S. Constitution) and that orthogonal areas of federal and
state law and jurisprudence are not disrupted.</font>
</p><p><b><i><font size="-1">Encouraging International Electronic Markets (Section
5)</font></i></b>
</p><p><font size="-1">The Abraham bill, recognizing the global potential of
electronic commerce, requires the federal government to follow certain
guidelines for the purpose of enabling international electronic transactions.
Under the bill, the federal government would adopt the principle that laws
and regulations that require paper and ink can be barriers to electronic
commerce and should be removed; that parties retain the right to choose
technologies and the ability to prove them in court; and that laws do not
discriminate against technologies from other jurisdictions. These principles
derive from a proposed International Convention, advocated by the U.S.
Department of Commerce and Department of State in various international
law-making bodies. Several state government associations have endorsed
this proposed U.S. convention (see Joint Resolution, at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070806102844/http://www.ec3.org/Public/Committees/Legal/JointResolution_neccrces.htm%29">http://www.ec3.org/Public/Committees/Legal/JointResolution_neccrces.htm)</a>.</font>
</p><p><b><i><font size="-1">The Basis for Interstate Commerce (Section 6)</font></i></b>
</p><p><font size="-1">It is cliché that "business abhors uncertainty."
While many experts have concluded that electronic contracts are not necessarily
invalid and that electronic signatures meet the common law definition of
a signature, nonetheless marketplace uncertainty remains regarding the
legality of these activities. The Abraham bill assures interstate commercial
contracts are not invalidated on the sole grounds that they are electronic.
It allows parties to use the technologies of their choice for electronic
signatures and records in interstate commercial transactions, and states
that an intent to electronically sign depends upon surrounding circumstances.
Finally, the bill states that state law is not preempted, provided the
state enacts laws consistent with this federal law or the UETA. These areas
are, on the whole, sufficiently narrow and well crafted to meet the five
questions posed above.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">The fact that scores of different electronic signature
statutes exist among states today, using different definitions, having
different scopes of application, and in some cases creating different legal
rights and obligations, has also contributed to the uncertainty in the
market. While careful analysis of these state laws reveals that no actual
conflicts currently exist, there is a fear of conflicting laws being enacted
in the future. A more legitimate criticism has been that additional legal
analysis of all 50 state laws to determine how they interrelate with respect
to electronic signatures and records adds significant and unnecessary transaction
costs to businesses engaged in interstate electronic commerce.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">Ultimately, business does not seem to care whether national
rules governing this field emerge from federal or uniform state sources.
The key is that the rules be sound (pro-market, non-regulatory, technology-neutral
and non-disruptive of other bodies of law) and that they be finalized in
the near future. Therefore, the balance struck in the Abraham bill on the
issue of state law preemption seems quite wise. The basic political logic
is: states that have laws on their books that comport with relevant sections
of this bill will not be preempted, and more importantly, that any state
that passes the UETA will qualify.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">The nod to the UETA is critical because it recognized
that this uniform law provides a comprehensive and detailed treatment of
contracts, signatures, records, negotiable instruments, notices and many
other areas of electronic transactions. Further, based on years of deliberation
and study, NCCUSL has assured that this law fits with all the related areas
of law implicated by use of an electronic signature and record. Obviously,
it is neceeary for state and not federal law to make these types of detailed
reforms in state law. However, until all states have uniform laws on the
narrower points in the Abraham bill, there <i>will be </i>a national base-line
on at least those issues. In the end, industry, which wants to lessen uncertainty
is served well by this approach because it gets federal uniformity on immediate
points and the federal bill acts as a catalyst for states to adopt uniform
law on the rest of the legal framework needed for electronic commerce.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">The bill provides certainty for private parties doing
business in any state under both state and federal law. As states enact
the UETA or other consistent law, then these matters would be dealt with
under that state law. Until a state adopts the UETA or other consistent
law, then gaps in law and inconsistent laws will be governed by this federal
legislation. For this reason, some people refer to the Abraham bill as
"bridge" legislation, that would create a national base-line immediately
under federal law, but would span the gap until states "do the right thing"
by adopting harmonized law through the UETA.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">While the Abraham bill does include some preemption of
state law, it strikes a justified balance. The bill does not make the mistake
of applying to signatures, records and contracts generally, but instead
deals only with a few narrow cases and is limited to interstate commerce.
The bill is consistent with the stated direction of uniform state law.
And the bill reverts jurisdictions to states once the state adopts such
law. However, a recalcitrant state that refuses to harmonize its laws with
a national baseline, however, will not create an impediment to interstate
electronic commerce under the Abraham bill.</font>
</p><center>
<p><b><font size="+1">Conclusion</font></b></p></center>

<p><font size="-1">A careful analysis of the Abraham bill indicates a passing
grade. This legislation correctly answers each of the policy criteria listed
above. Under question one: the bill is narrowly tailored and does not reach
to all signatures, records, contracts, agreements or the like. Under question
two: the bill promotes a competitive marketplace by not specifying any
technology, omnibus security criteria or special business model. Under
question three: the bill provides for absolutely no new regulation or government
approvals needed in the market. Under question four: while the bill does
preempt narrow areas of state law, it appears to be sufficiently narrow
so as not to be disruptive. In addition, the bill would promote non-preempted
adoption of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. Finally, under question
five: the bill does not unduly advantage any single economic sector. In
short, S. 761 is non-regulatory, narrowly tailored to legitimate concerns,
technology neutral, pro-market, and respectful of the state/federal balance
of jurisdictions over commerce. Given existing Senate support, strong industry
backing, and the potential for support from states, it seems that this
bill has excellent chances of success this session.</font>
