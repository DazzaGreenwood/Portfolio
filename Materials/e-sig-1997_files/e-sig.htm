The following article deals generally with legal aspects of electronic


signatures and writings.  Though the article is not specifically


tailored to medical systems, the information is quite relevant


to the field of health care and the topics under consideration


for this Massachusetts Continuing Legal Education program.  The


document is a draft of an article that will be published in the


National Law Journal.  While I am solely responsible for this


draft, the ultimate article will be co-authored with attorney


Lee Gesmer, a partner of the Boston law firm Lucash, Gesmer and


Updegrove, specializing in the field of high technology law. 


It should also be noted that, while I am an attorney for the Commonwealth


of Massachusetts and reference is made throughout this article


to legal and policy matters involving the Commonwealth, I submit


this work in my personal capacity and nothing herein necessarily


represents the views, positions or any official comment by the


Commonwealt <A NAME = rfn1></A>. <A HREF = "#fn1">1 </A> 


<P>


Information technology can be a powerful enabling tool for health


care.  According to the Chicago Tribune<A NAME = rfn2></A>, <A HREF = "#fn2">2 </A>    a 21-year-old student


in China fell into a coma due to a mysterious illness.  The finest


doctors in Beijing were unable to diagnose or treat her, and her


condition was fast deteriorating.  Her friends sent a desperate


plea for help over the Internet, describing her symptoms and requesting


assistance.  Some 2,000 doctors and researchers in 18 countries


replied to the message, and from those responses the illness'


cause was established.  The young student's life was saved as


a result of that use of the Internet.  This dramatic example illustrates


the previously impossible communications made simple, inexpensive


and commonly accessible through use of networked computer<A NAME = rfn3></A>. <A HREF = "#fn3">3</A>      <BR>


<P>


An early Clinton Administration health security proposal suggested


the following benefits from a national health information infrastructure:


<BR>


<P>


1. clear and useful consumer information


<br>


2. health status measures


<br>


3. health care system monitoring and evaluation


<br>


4. linking health record information to improve patient care


<br>


5. cost effective, streamlined administration, and


<br>


6. identification of fraudulent activities <A NAME = rfn4></A> <A HREF = "#fn4">4</A>  <BR>


<P>


 Commentators have noted that the benefits of networked health


care information outweigh the risks to privacy<A NAME = rfn5></A>. <A HREF = "#fn5">5</A>     Though providing


for adequate information security protections can involve significant


investments, the cost savings to be had from widespread use of


new communications technologies are staggering.  For instance,


switching to electronic data interchange (EDI) would yield billions


of dollars in savings annually<A NAME = rfn6></A>. <A HREF = "#fn6">6</A>    The current paper based system


is ill suited to health care in both form and function.  The Government


Accounting Office estimates that the 34 million hospital admissions


and 1.2 billion physicians visits each year generate the equivalent


of 10 billion pages of medical records<A NAME = rfn7></A>. <A HREF = "#fn7">7</A>     <BR>


<P>


 Evidently, not only is medical data voluminous, but it is also


poorly organized - sometimes inaccessible when needed and existing


in several different locations, though associated with a single


patient, perhaps even a single episode<A NAME = rfn8></A>. <A HREF = "#fn8">8</A>                   In addition to administrative


and cost savings, networked computing presents conspicuous advantages


in quality of care and research directly advance the core mission


of health care<A NAME = rfn9></A>. <A HREF = "#fn9">9</A>    The benefits of electronic information systems


include accessible and comprehensive patient records, networked


consultations without regard to geography, ease of treatment tracking


and instant availability of critical clinical and research data


capable of being queried, stored and cross-indexed to a patients


file.<BR>


<P>


 Several leading organizations in the field of medicine have publicly


advocated for moving toward integration of information technologies


into health care systems, including the American Hospital Association


and the Institute of Medicine's Committee on Regional Health Data


Networks<A NAME = rfn10></A>. <A HREF = "#fn10">10</A>   It is only a matter of time before ubiquitously networked


computer systems allow for spontaneous, secure, authenticated


and confidential transactions around the world.  The cost and


quality efficiencies of such an Information Infrastructure promise


untold benefits in all sectors of the economy and society.  As


this transition hastens, attorneys will increasingly be asked


for advice about the legal consequences of creating, receiving,


transmitting, destroying and converting to electronic records.


 The role of electronic signatures, network security, and the


contracts and licenses associated with digital systems and services


will play a key role in the practice of modern law.  The field


of health care, with its special concern for confidentiality and


literally life and death reliance on the accuracy and timeliness


of information presents the strongest challenge and the greatest


opportunities for adoption of emerging information technology.


 Legal and policy  infrastructure supporting computer networks


will be vital to the success of this transition.

 The world is changing and the lawyers must change with it.  A


digital revolution has begun.  The wide-scale transition from


traditional forms of writing and communication is creating uncertainty


in commerce, health care, government and all social and economic


sectors.  Specifically, records are increasingly created, transmitted


and stored in electronic media and parties are using computer


networks to access and communicate information with other parties.


 What is the legal status of an electronic signature?  Are electronic


records the legal equivalent of paper writings?  It is clear that


such uses of electronic data are saving enormous administrative


and other transactional costs.  The ability to access information


in digital form is also creating qualitative cultural and economic


improvements by allowing world-wide networked publishing, trade,


education and interactive collaborations.  However, the legal


implications of these changes will require attorneys to adapt


to new vocabularies and ways of thinking.  This article will explore


issues surrounding the use of electronic signatures and writings


in the context of information security and the law.<BR>

A digital signature allows a party to send a secure message over


an open, otherwise non-secure computer network.  The phrase digital


signature is a term of art.  A digital signature is not based


on an actual hand signed image, rather it is based on a complex


mathematical formula that allows networked communications to be


authenticated, confidential and non-repudiable.  Though the technology


is involved, it is helpful that lawyers have at least a passing


understanding of the underlying content of digital signatures.


 There are two basic technical processes that combine to make


a digital signature.  The first function is known as &quot;public


key encryption.&quot;  The second function is called a &quot;hash.&quot;


 Encryption is simply the process by which information is scrambled


by use of a code.  <BR>


<P>


Military communications have relied on more or less advanced methods


of encryption for thousands of years.  In fact, Alexander the


Great communicated with his generals by sending messages in which


each letter was shifted a certain number of positions (a two position


shift replaces every &quot;a&quot; with a &quot;c&quot;, every


&quot;b&quot; with a &quot;d&quot;, and so on).  This was a form


of &quot;secret key encryption&quot; - because anyone who knew


the secret code could send and receive messages securely.  Today,


commercially available encryption software creates encryption


so strong that it is all but impossible to break the code and


ascertain the original message without the use of the authorized


software.  <BR>

<P>


 Unfortunately, a secret key system requires the sender to transmit


the code to the receiver in a safe manner - not allowing the code


to fall into unauthorized hands - because anyone with the secret


code can read all messages sent.  Since the Internet is very vulnerable


to message interception, it becomes impractical to deliver the


secret code to message recipients.  Enter: Public Key Cryptography.


 With this type of encryption, information that is encrypted with


one key from a given pair can only be decrypted by the other key.


 This is similar to the old &quot;secret decoder rings&quot; found


in boxes of Cracker Jacks.  Users of this system would keep their


private key very safe (perhaps password protected or even embedded


in a smartcard or other hardware device) but they would make their


public key freely available, by sending it to all potential recipients


of messages or posting it to an Internet public key directory.


 In this way, the private key holder can send a message to anyone


on the Internet, and, if his public key decrypts the message,


the recipient knows it must have come from the private key holder.


 Conversely, anyone on the Internet that wants to send the private


key holder a message can encrypt the message with his public key


(again, the public key is freely available) and send the message


with the knowledge that only the private key holder can read the


encrypted text.  <BR>


<P>


 For example, if you receive a message from John Smith, and you


use Smith's public key to successfully unencrypt the message,


you know, to an extremely high degree of certainty, that Smith,


and not an impostor, wrote the message.  The message could <I>only</I>


have been created by someone with Smith's private key, and presumably


the only person with Smith's private key is Smith.  This can be


seen as the equivalent of a signature on the data sent by Smith


- a so-called &quot;digital signature.&quot;<BR>

 A &quot;hash function&quot; is a process that creates a relatively


small number that represents a much larger amount of electronic


data.  For instance, if I had a ten page word processing document


on my computer hard drive, I could use special hashing software


to derive a particular number associated with that document. 


If even one comma were changed on the document, the resulting


hash number from the changed document would be completely different.


 This number is called the &quot;message digest.&quot;    Digital


signatures use a &quot;one way hash function&quot; - that means


there is no way to reverse engineer or derive the content of the


message based on the resulting message digest.  When you send


a digest along with a message, the recipient can check to see


if the message has been tampered with by using the same hashing


software to make her own digest of the message and then checking


to see if the two numbers match.  If the digest number sent with


the message matches the digest created by the recipient, then


she know that the message is exactly the same as when it was sent.


<BR>


<P>


 To achieve a digital signature, the sender's software creates


a message digest and then encrypts that number with the sender's


private key.  This &quot;encrypted digest&quot; is then sent along


with the text of the message.  That way, the recipient can determine


both who the message came from and that the content has not been


tampered with just by decrypting the digest and checking to see


that it matches the digest of the message she received.<BR>


<P>


 The entire message could also be encrypted, but that would only


be done to achieve confidentiality of the message.  If the sender


merely wants to sign a message, only the digest needs to be encrypted.


 This is important because it is significantly quicker to send


a receive messages that are not encrypted.  The technology is


developing to give users a choice when a message is sent: you


can &quot;sign&quot; the message or &quot;sign and encrypt&quot;


the entire message.  Remember, it will cost additional delays


and computer resources to use encryption for confidentiality as


well as signatures, so think about when you want to use each.


 This system, however, will not require any technical expertise


among users above that required to use a word processor.  The


process will be nearly &quot;transparent&quot; to the end user.


 All that will be required is a few clicks of the mouse to sign


or encrypt messages and to accept and review the signed messages


sent to the user.  <BR>

<P>


 The issue, legally, is to bind the identity of a particular party


to a particular public key.  This need has been widely perceived


in the marketplace and several companies are stepping into the


so-called &quot;trusted third party&quot; business.  Such a company


is known as a certification authority (C/A). The C/A will issue


a certificate that identifies the person associated with a given


public key (the &quot;subscriber&quot;).  The C/A is responsible


for undertaking certain measures to ascertain the identity of


the person to whom it issues a certificate.  The market appears


to be evolving toward tiered levels of certificates.  Relatively


inexpensive certificates may only represent an attestation by


the C/A that the subscriber presented a notarized letter indicating


her identity through the U.S. mail.  More expensive certificates


might be issued based on more stringent measures by the C/A, such


as requiring the subscriber to physically show up at a location


and present multiple forms of photo identifications and so on <A NAME = rfn11></A>. <A HREF = "#fn11">11</A>         


<BR>


<P>


 When the subscriber wishes to use her private key to sign a record,


she would send a certificate, issued by a C/A along with the transmission.


 That way, the relying party who receives the transmission can


independently verify the identity of the subscriber by reference


to the C/A's online database of valid certificates and revoked


certificates.  A subscriber would have a responsibility to notify


the C/A if she discovers that her private key has been lost or


compromised.  In this case, the C/A would post this information


to a Certificate Revocation List.  Prudent persons would check


such a list before relying on a given certificate.  Banks, the


U.S. Post Office, and several other large and small entities are


positioning to become C/As.   <BR>


<P>


In a sense, the entire public key system is built on two deep


fault lines.  First, the private key of the subscriber must remain


secure.  If the private key is stolen or used without authorization,


the whole system falls.  Secondly, there must be a trusted third


party to the transaction.  Without this certification, again,


the system falls.   The recipient must have objective grounds


for confidence that the public key which &quot;unlocks&quot; the


signature, leading to the critical elements of authenticity and


message integrity, is associated with Smith.   Without this assurance,


the fact that a public key unlocks a message encrypted with a


private key has no meaning other than that the two keys are mathematically


related.  Today, there is a serious debate about what policies


and practices C/As should use.  It is clear that this system requires


some common understanding among C/As and the user population regarding


uniform levels of authentication of the subscribers.  There are


multiple views about what, if any, laws are called for at present


to further define, and perhaps limit, the rights and liabilities


of C/As, subscribers and relying parties who use this system.

 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has assumed a leadership position


among states with regard to the creation of a public key infrastructure.


 The Commonwealth is working with several national organizations


of state government officials to bring together the fledgling


C/A industry for the purpose of discussing more coordinated, predictable


and uniform business practices and standards.  There must be an


objective method, such as accepted standards, accreditation or


licensing whereby consumers, government and business can identify


which C/As will be worthy of trust.  The elements of a trustworthy


C/A extend to very technical specification as well as to business


practices.  Ideally, voluntary, testable, widely recognized industry


standards will develop, rather than more rigid government conceived


promulgations.  The Commonwealth is also actively involved with


joint federal and state efforts to coordinate electronic commerce


policies on a national level.  In addition to policy work, the


Commonwealth is gaining practical experience with this technology


as a business tool.  The Registry of Motor Vehicles web site now


uses point to point encryption over the Internet to allow confidential


transmission of credit card transactions to renew vehicle registration,


pay citations and even order vanity license plates.  The Division


of Banks is about to begin a pilot using digital certificates


to enable banks to file authenticated documents over the state's


Internet web site.  The Information Technology Division makes


information available about Commonwealth secure Internet initiatives

<P>


 An electronic signature is, simply, any symbol or method executed


or adopted by a party with present intention to be bound by or


to authenticate a record, accomplished by electronic means.  An


electronic signature may be created be any electronic means. 


For instance, a sophisticated bio-metric device, such as a fingerprint


computer recognition system could qualify as an electronic signature,


and so would the simple entry of a typed name at the end of an


e-mail message.  The principle is that the symbol or method was


executed or adopted by the signer with <I>a present intent to


sign the record</I>.  This definition focuses on the traditional


legal purposes of a signature, not the particular medium or manner


chosen to accomplish the signature.  By contrast, a digital signature


refers to a particular implementation of public key cryptography.


 <BR>


<P>


 A digital signature can be defined to mean a transformation of


a record using an asymmetric cryptosystem and a hash function


such that a person having the initial record and the signer's


public key can accurately determine: (a) whether the transformation


was created using the private key that corresponds to the signer's


public key; and (b) whether the initial record has been altered


since the transformation was made.  In other words, a digital


signature is created by use of a public key system, but an electronic


signature includes broadly any computer method, including, but


not limited to, public key systems.  Digital signatures are technology


specific.  Electronic signatures are technology neutral.<BR>


<P>


 The use of low security electronic signatures, such as simply


typing one's name on an e-mail, raises serious questions of proof


regarding the authenticity of such a signature.  However, there


are times when low or no levels of security are warranted.  A


given transaction or message may be informal, of little or no


value nor otherwise reasonably likely to form the basis of subsequent


dispute.  For instance, it is common practice to conclude purely


social e-mail messages with the typing of the sender's name. 


In this case, the name would be a symbol intended to authenticate


the document, but not necessarily manifesting an intent to be


bound by the content - assuming there exists any particular content


at all.  In this context, the word &quot;authenticate&quot; means


merely an intent to represent that the signer was the sender.


 In common parlance, e-mail among friends and close colleagues


is often concluded with the initials of the sender alone.  For


more formal, but low risk, electronic transactions, a more robust


signature system may be desirable.  This does not necessarily


mean a full fledged public key solution is required.  For example,


some business and professional online services require a user


name and password to access their system.  Once a user is on the


system, they may be entitled to additional information or services,


such as online dialogue with an expert or authorization to view


value-added proprietary documents.  Here, the electronic signature


is created by use of a user name and password, probably relying


on access control technology far less expensive and simpler to


use than public key cryptosystems.  The use of this system may


(depending on the understanding of the parties as evidenced by


contracts, disclaimers or other conditions of use) authenticate


the user and also impliedly, or perhaps expressly, express an


intent to be bound by billing rates or other terms.  <BR>

 As mentioned earlier, digital signatures, when properly implemented,


provide an extremely high degree of confidence that a message


originated from the person or entity it purports to come from


and that the message was not altered.  In addition, the current


implementation of this technology relies on particular digital


certificates that comply with internationally recognized standards.


 This current standard, known as X.509v3, provides for the inclusion


of several data fields that specify the name of the private key


holder (the subscriber), the name of the issuing certification


authority, the period during which the certificate is valid and


a copy of the subscriber's relevant public key.  <BR>


<P>


 This current version of this standard is particularly exciting


for legal and policy reasons because it also allows for a number


of so-called &quot;certificate extensions&quot; - that is, data


fields with no predetermined use.  These open fields can be used


to further customize a certificate for a given industry or individual


use.  Additional fields might designate a reasonable monetary


reliance limit to be associated with a given certificate, or some


indication of the signer's authorization limits.  Unlike a traditional


pen and ink signature, a digital signature with a customized certificate


could denote, in detail, the types of transactions a given employee


is authorized to enter or the role a signer is playing within


a company.  For instance, Mr. Gates may use one private key to


buy low dollar items on the Internet for his personal use or to


sign his weekly time sheets (hey - its possible).  He might keep


this key on his desktop hard drive and protect it with a password.


 However, to sign important high dollar deals Mr. Gates may chose


to use a different key, denoting him as the CEO who is authorized


to bind his company.  This key may be protected with a more expensive


and more trustworthy system, perhaps including smart cards or


biometric devices.<BR>

 The role of attorneys in assessing the adequacy of a digital


signature, particularly in a jurisdiction without detailed digital


signature legislation, will involve a special evaluation and recommendation


process.  More so than most other fields of legal practice, information


technology issues will form the basis of unfamiliar, dynamic and


complex facts and circumstances for most lawyers.  The technology


is, by nature, fast evolving and very complicated.  Even if you


have a computer science degree, you will have to take additional


time making sure you understand the basics of current and future


technological systems.  However, lawyers do not need computer


science degrees to render sound legal advice to clients seeking


guidance in these matters.  In the context of electronic signatures,


and the probable commercial uses to which they will be put, there


are a relatively few key concepts that can be used to assure an


accurate &quot;big picture&quot; view of particular technologies.


 <BR>


<P>


 There are an increasing number of technologies being developed


that would provide for varying levels of security over open networks.


 Clients will look to attorneys and others for guidance about


the appropriate level of security for a given line of electronic


business or other transactions.  Of course, the average attorney


will not be expected to render technical judgments about the information


technology investments their clients make.  Very technical analysis


can be involved in making such selections, such as interoperability


with existing information technology systems, costs to administer,


trends in the industry and so on.  However, it is going to be


very important for attorneys to cooperate closely with business


and technical people in the procurement and deployment of certain


computer security systems generally, and systems that require


electronic signatures specifically.  The legal consequences that


flow from the presence or absence of particular elements of data


security will constitute risks, liabilities and other potential


costs that should be taken into account from the beginning.  Similarly,


relatively small changes to the purchase, or implementation, of


a large electronic system can drastically improve a clients position


should the system ever be implicated in or form the basis of a


dispute, or formal adjudication.  <BR>


<P>


 A full discussion of network security would necessarily include


exploration of disaster recovery systems, physical security, audit


trails, security policies, procedures, training and so on. Leaving


aside, for purposes of this article, these important but more


general issues of network and systems security, lawyers should


pay special attention to five basic legal and technical elements


when assessing a given electronic signature or other network security


system.  Security, in this context, consists of: authentication,


access control, confidentiality, message integrity and non-repudiation.


These are the terms of art that will form an important part of


every lawyers thinking and advice in the field of information


technology law for years to come.  Each one of these terms has


a specific technical meaning and distinct legal and policy implications.


 Here is a very general description of each term:  





<UL>


<LI><B>Authentication:</B> This is achieved by ascertaining the identities


of parties to a message or transaction. <BR>


<LI><B>Access Control:</B> This means that information, and other


network resources, are available only to authorized parties. 


<BR>


<LI><B>Confidentiality:</B> This is achieved by keeping the contents


of a message or substance of a transaction secret to unauthorized


parties. <BR>


<LI><B>Message Integrity:</B> This is achieved by ascertaining that


a message or other transmission has not been tampered with in


transit over a computer network, i.e., it is accurate. <BR>


<LI><B>Non-Repudiation:</B> This means that evidence exists tying


the identity of a party to the substance of a message or transaction


at a certain point in time and the evidence is sufficiently strong


to prevent or rebut that party's subsequent denial of same.  


</Ul>


 As lawyers, we will increasingly be called upon to develop a


legal analysis involving one or more of the above concepts.  These


technical terms are cropping up in a host of every-day situations.


 For instance, as more medical records are made available to treating


physicians over multi-hospital computer networks and even over


the Internet, it is vital that the confidentiality of those records


is maintained.  Similarly, whenever a credit card number and expiration


date are transmitted, that information should be kept confidential


both in the merchants computer system and while in transit over


the network.  Assurance of message integrity is necessary to prove


the contents of a contract agreed to by means of electronic commerce.


 One seeking to prove a contract will want to show that every


clause, word and character in such a contract was received accurately


- exactly as it was transmitted.  <BR>


<P>


 Access control can prevent unauthorized users from availing themselves


of certain non-confidential, but valuable network resources, such


as computationally demanding analysis programs or scarce communications


bandwidth.  In addition, access control measures can stop unauthorized


users from viewing, deleting or otherwise manipulating sensitive


data.  For instance, a bank might wish to post current interest


rates on an Internet web site.  This information is not confidential,


in fact, it is widely publicized, but the bank will require assurance


that individuals from the general public who are viewing that


information can not manipulate the data and change the posted


interest rates.<BR>


<P>


 The concepts of authentication and non-repudiation are particularly


important.  In order to separate &quot;authorized&quot; users


of information from &quot;unauthorized&quot; users, there must


be some reliable way to ascertain the identity of the user.  The


Internet was not designed with adequate technical means to achieve


this identification.  In fact, without the existence of more robust


security measures. it is quite easy to &quot;spoof&quot; the identity


of another person on the Internet.  The apparent origin and return


address on an e-mail message, for instance, is quite subject to


impersonation.  There are several means, not involving cryptography,


to achieve authentication, including by use of a password or PIN,


a hardware device (perhaps as simple as an inexpensive thin plastic


card with a unique magnetic strip), voice recognition, and many


other methods.  Authentication information can be used as the


basis for other programs that control access or save the authentication


data in order to forestall subsequent attempts to repudiate transmission


or receipt of a message or transaction.    


<P>


 


<P>


 Finally, though related, the elements of non-repudiation should


not be confused with the legal notion of contract &quot;repudiation.&quot;


 Non-repudiation should be thought of as sufficient technical


evidence that a particular party submitted or received a particular


transmission.  Some state statutes are creating evidentiary rebuttable


presumptions that a transmission was submitted or received by


a particular party under specified technical circumstances, such


as when a digital signature is used.  The emerging legislative


trend, however, seems to be more technology neutral.  Under this


approach, proof that a &quot;secure system,&quot; (defined to


include the basic elements of a trustworthy system) was used to


generate and transmit the signature will create a rebuttable presumption


that the signature is authentic<A NAME = rfn12></A>. <A HREF = "#fn12">12</A>           However, it is helpful to remember


that achieving non-repudiation does not necessarily mean that


a party will be bound by an obligation or that a given contract


will be enforceable.  The laws of contract will, of course, still


operate to allow defenses to enforcement and to rebut contract


formation based on incapacity, mistake, illegality and so on.


 Courts will continue to look to whether substantial performance


has been rendered and other legal requirements met.  However,


the technical elements of non-repudiation operate to form a solid


business and legal foundation on which to build reliable communications.

 It may be helpful, when presented with a request for legal advice


based on a client's planned or present use of a secure network


system, to run through each of the five elements listed above


with the client, or technical person making the presentation.


 Based on the answers, you should be able to determine which,


if any, of the five elements is present, and to what degree. 


For instance, if, upon inquiry, you determine that there is a


method for authentication, but no way to assure non-repudiation,


then business functions that require billing or creation of other


obligations should be questioned. For example, if the computer


server merely authenticates the identity of a party upon entry


into the system for access control purposes, but then either deletes,


over-writes or fails to save that information, then potentially


valuable data to prove non-repudiation is being lost.  It may


be fruitful to discuss whether there is a way to archive the authentication


data in a secure way that would allow it to be entered into evidence


should a formal adjudication ever result.  The client could consider


any number of process' that would allow you, or the trial attorney,


to lay a proper foundation for introduction of the authentication


information.  <BR>


<P>


 Basic issues to consider include proof of the following: the


reliability of the hardware and software used; the accuracy of


data entered; the integrity of stored records; and; the reliability


of the process whereby records are retrieved for the court in


perceivable form.  However, for the non-repudiation element in


particular, you should contemplate how the system will support


the admissibility and weight of evidence that a particular party


sent a message or engaged in a transaction.  For instance, think


about how the system ensures that the disputed information is


identified with the party (was a password given to the signer


and was there an agreement about keeping the password safe?) and


that unauthorized persons did not have the opportunity to create


the or manipulate the information after the transaction (does


the server have limited physical and software access - what other


procedures are in place to prevent unauthorized access?).  These


facts will assist in laying a proper foundation and proffering


persuasive evidence.  <BR>

 It will be some time before digital signature technology is pervasively


used, and it is entirely possible that it will remain merely one


of several technologies for information security.  Given current


growth rates, it is clear that, in the meantime, every area of


the economy will increase use of computer networks secured by


other technologies.  Information security technology and related


costs of business process can absorb inordinate amounts of available


resources, unless carefully managed.  A modern trend in legal


analysis of such systems requires a balancing test.  Specifically,


an attorney should ask whether the reliability of the method used


to create, store, and communicate the signature or electronic


record was appropriate for the purposes for which it was created


and transmitted.  A broad range or financial, legal and other


relevant factors should be considered and balanced when determining


the advisability of a given network security or signature system.


<BR>


<P>


 As a general observation, it seems that many attorneys and other


professional initially expect near perfect information security


systems to be in place when a process shift from paper to electronic


medium is contemplated.  While it is true that some vulnerabilities


to the information increase when it is converted to electronic


form (ranging from a simple power surge, to a malicious virus),


in many, possibly most, situations, the digital information is


actually more secure.  Relatively small information security precautions


can render the same information far safer when in electronic form.


 One should be wary of unreasonable expectations or demands for


near 100% security from every conceivable threat just because


information is to be maintained in electronic rather than paper


form.  A more appropriate, if general, benchmark is to ask whether


the electronic system affords approximately the same or better


security than analogous paper systems.  This type of analysis


should deliberately balance the costs of various security systems


against the risks of security breach in light of the entire enterprise.


 Of course, some functions will require extremely high degrees


of security.  Typically, such a security system commands significant


financial and personnel resources to create and maintain.  Determining


the right level of information security should be the result of


searching analysis of the business, legal and other demands on


the enterprise.<BR>

 Based on the description of public key cryptography earlier in


this article, it is possible to define precisely how it is so


well suited to meet each of the five postulated elements of network


security.  When the recipient receives a digitally signed message,


if the subscribers public key decrypts the message digest, then


the recipient knows to a mathematical certainty that the subscriber's


private key must have encrypted the message.  If the certificate


indicates that the subscriber is the same person purports to have


sent the message, then the recipient knows the signature is authentic


(assuming the certification authority inspires sufficient trust


and the certificate is listed as valid and not revoked on the


C/As database).  This part of the process provides evidence of


authentication.  Once the digest is decrypted, the recipient can


run the message through a hash function and, if the resulting


digest matches the digest that was sent in encrypted form, then


the recipient know that the message has not been altered.  In


other words, this process of sending an encrypted message digest


along with a message can provide solid proof of authentication


and message integrity.   <BR>


<P>


 But, what about access control, confidentiality and non-repudiation?


 Access control can be achieved based on a digital certificate


quite easily today.  In fact, standard browsers come with the


Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol built in.  The current version


protocol (SSL3) allows for the automatic exchange of digital certificates


between a web browser and a web server, thus creating cross-authentication.


 This information can form the basis of a server program that


only allows browsers with certain certificates into secure areas


of the web site.  Hence, SSL3 can be used to control access to


network resources based on the identity of the party seeking to


use the resource.  Though the basic formulation for a digital


signature does not require that the message be encrypted, if the


message were encrypted, then the contents would be confidential.


 Finally, non-repudiation can be achieved by keeping records of


the original message, the associated encrypted message digest


and the attached digital certificate.  With these items, if the


sender of the message later attempted to deny having sent the


message, then it could be shown that: 1. his public key decrypts


a given message digest; 2. that message digest corresponds to


the message in question; and 3. the relevant certification authority


listed his certificate as valid at the time of the transaction.


 To pinpoint the time of the transaction, a digital time stamp


service or other general server logs may also be necessary.

 Today, there exist a number of legal requirements for transactions


to be evidenced by a &quot;writing&quot; or to be &quot;signed.&quot;


 The most commonly referenced signature requirement is the Statute


of Frauds.  However, a large number, perhaps thousands, of federal,


state and local laws, regulations and ordinances also call for


a &quot;writing&quot; and a &quot;signature.&quot;  Some of these


laws specifically require the writing to be on &quot;paper&quot;


and the signature to be &quot;in ink.&quot;  These so-called quill

 In the notable case of <U>Gilmore v Lujan</U><A NAME = rfn13></A>, <A HREF = "#fn13">13 </A>      the requirement


for a lease to be signed was rigidly adhered to by a federal agency


when the agency killed a significant business transaction based


solely on a faxed rather than ink signature.  The court admonished


the agency for their harsh and unreasonable application of a regulation


requiring a &quot;holographic signature,&quot; but recognized


the right of the agency to so act based on the law as written.


 The court noted:<BR>


<P>


<FONT SIZE=2>While in this instance, denial produces a harsh result,


a telefaxed signature is a machine produced signature.  It is


the exact situation the amended regulations sought to address.

of the court's review of agency decisions.  Obviously the equities


favor Gilmore, as he is guilty of no omission but use of the United

commissions, one appointment as special commissioner or referee

of a fax machine to communicate official acts of the Chief Executive


of the state was valid.  In fact, the attention of the court was


on the question of the Governor's authority to exercise executive


power while out of state, based on the state's constitution.

to adopt such a law was Utah.  The Utah law, enacted in 1995 and


amended in March of 1996 is widely recognized as an important


and positive first step toward legal recognition of digital signature


technology.  The Utah act provides for the licensure of certification


authorities by the Utah Department of Commerce.  Utah's law also


details the rights and liabilities of parties to a transaction


using public key cryptography and a licensed certification authority.


 Washington state adopted legislation closely resembling the Utah


law early in 1996.  Other states, most notably Georgia, began


considering Utah modeled bills and, for a time, it seemed a consensus


was developing among states.<BR>


<P>


 While a number of states have considered using the Utah act as


a model, various policy issues have increasingly moved states


toward less regulatory, less technology specific and more incremental


approaches.  For example, the states of California and Arizona


enacted legislation permitting use of digital signatures for transactions


with public entities in each state, respectively.  This legislation


authorized their Secretaries of State to promulgate regulations


to achieve the purpose of the act.  Still other states passed


laws permitting the use of electronic signatures for particular


purposes, such as for medical records in the state of Connecticut


or for budget and accounting purposes, such as electronic check


signing by the Treasurer of the state of Delaware.  Georgia, and


a number of states that had legislation resembling the Utah act,


allowed the bills to die and opted for further study.<BR>


<P>


 Today, a new trend is developing among legislative drafters and


policy makers.  The state of Massachusetts, notably, exemplifies


an effort to craft laws that directly address the legal issues


raised by electronic commerce but do not exclusively enshrine


public key cryptography in statute.  This approach seeks to remove


legal obstacles to electronic communications and transactions


generally, by giving legal effect to electronic signatures and


electronic records.  The law would also specifically provide for


the admissibility of electronic signatures and records.  The draft


proposed statute <A NAME = rfn15></A> <A HREF = "#fn15">15</A>       reads, in pertinent part:<BR>


<P>


<FONT SIZE=2>Section 1. Definitions. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>retrievable in perceivable form. The term &quot;record&quot;


includes both electronic records and written records. <BR>


</FONT>


<P>


<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Signed&quot; or &quot;signature&quot; means

 The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)


recently proposed a Model Law on Electronic Commerce.  The UNCITRAL


Model Law takes high level, enabling approach to electronic signatures


and records, with no mention of digital signatures or cryptography.


 The UNCITRAL model law reads, in pertinent part, as follows:


<BR>


<P>


<FONT SIZE=2>Article 6. Writing<BR>


</FONT>


<P>


<FONT SIZE=2>(1) Where the law requires information to be in writing,


that requirement is met by a data message if the information contained


therein is accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference.


<BR>


</FONT>


<P>


<FONT SIZE=2>(2) Paragraph (1) applies whether the requirement


therein is in the form of an obligation or whether the law simply


provides consequences for the information not being in writing.


<BR>


</FONT>


<P>


<FONT SIZE=2>(3) The provisions of this article do not apply to


the following [...].<BR>


</FONT>


<P>


<FONT SIZE=2>Article 7. Signature<BR>


</FONT>


<P>


<FONT SIZE=2>(1) Where the law requires a signature of a person,


that requirement is met in relation to a data message if:<BR>


</FONT>


<P>


<FONT SIZE=2>(a) a method is used to identify that person and


to indicate that person's approval of the information contained


in the data message; and<BR>


</FONT>


<P>


<FONT SIZE=2>(b) that method is as reliable as was appropriate


for the purpose for which the data message was generated of communicated,


in light of all the circumstances, including any relevant agreement.


<BR>


</FONT>


<P>


<FONT SIZE=2>(2) Paragraph (1) applies whether the requirement

The National Conference of Commissioners for Uniform State Law


have been guided by the UNCITRAL approach in drafting efforts


to revise Uniform Commercial Code Article 2, covering the sale


of goods, and the soon to be proposed Article 2B, covering the


license of digital information.  The current legislative draft


of electronic signature legislation for the states of Illinois


and Oklahoma contain similar language and represent a similar


approach.  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts electronic signature


law and policy web site, available at &lt;http://www.state.ma.us/itd/legal&gt;,


contains the text, or links to, these and other relevant legislative


proposals and enactments.  There is an emerging realization that


electronic signature statutes should be broad and general, while


the policies, regulations (if any) and contracts will be more


detailed and flexibly responsive to particular technologies used


in particular circumstances.  <BR>


<P>


 Largely unnoticed, but also very significant, is the new federal


Health Insurance Portability Act of 1996.  This law contains provisions


that would establish standards and requirements for the electronic


transmission of certain health information.  Most notably, the


act specifically addresses the role of electronic signatures in


health care transactions.  The act provides for the adoption of


&quot;standards specifying procedures for the electronic transmission


and authentication of signatures&quot; with respect to the broad


range of transactions covered by the act.  Of particular relevance,


the drafters specifically provided that electronic signatures


that comply with the standards promulgated by Health and Human


Services shall &quot;be deemed to satisfy Federal and State statutory


requirements for written signatures.&quot;  While it remains to


be seen whether the Secretary of HHS will deem fit to adopt technology


specific or more general regulations, it is clear that legally


recognized electronic signatures and records are on the verge


of common usage in the American health care - a very significant


national economic cluster.<BR>


<P>


 There are several policy factors favoring a Massachusetts style


approach to electronic records and signature legislation.  While


the capabilities of a widely used global public key system would


be staggering, the technical infrastructure necessary to enable


such a system is still years away.  Given the dynamic and unpredictable


nature of technological evolution, there is still good reason


to refrain from definitive expectations about the shape, scope


and type of international information security systems of the


future.  Yet, in the meantime, business, health care, education,


government and other key economic sectors are moving toward business


uses of existing technology, such as e-mail, moving documents


and programs (file transfer protocol), and basic web browsing


(hyper text transfer protocol).  Other security systems are providing


some or all of the essential elements of network communications


security, from elaborate biometric devices (for finger prints


or retina scans) to simple software security requiring a password


or other PIN.  The law, and attorneys in particular, must take


account of this reality so as not to deny the legal effect of


legitimate transactions that happen to occur electronically and


to lend needed stability and predictability for these activities.


 As technology changes and the market emerges, more detailed state


law will always be an option for individual or uniform statutes.


 The use of public key cryptography and certification authorities


would more than qualify for legal recognition under the Massachusetts


approach.  The Massachusetts approach is consistent with the recent


UNCITRAL Model Law and would provide a relatively simple legal


expression for all fifty states and the federal government to


adopt, thus providing a needed base-line for electronic commerce.

 The legal profession, and society in general, stands at the cusp


of a profound change - a revolutionary shift to the digital age.


 A number of voices have sounded the alarm to beware of the &quot;wild


west&quot; of cyberspace.  Some advocate enactment of an array


of protective comprehensive statutes, tailored to meet the special


host of issues presented by the new information technologies.


 It is doubtful that any particular suite of laws would be sufficient,


or desirable, as a legal response to the information age.  It


may be more accurate to say that nearly all fields of law will


undergo a transition that reflects and shapes the underlying movement


toward electronically based information and communication.  When


our civilization transition to the industrial age, our legal system


did not adapt by the mere addition of a new area of &quot;industrial


law.&quot;  Rather, nearly every area of law was transformed by,


and helped to create, the new economic, social and political realities


associated with the industrial revolution and our subsequent industrial


civilization.  Similarly, the pervasive information revolution


will relegate many currently familiar concepts to irrelevant historical


curiosities.  The meaning of a signature will certainly be among


the definitions to evolve.  Yet, the law has proven to be resilient


and capable of undergoing dynamic reshaping over the centuries.


 Our principles of due process, open society, economic freedom


and self-government remain ageless beacons.  We would be better


served by more calls to constructive action, rather than the frequent


vague alarms sounded about the coming digital revolution.  The


change is coming - indeed it is already upon us - and the bar


must rise to the challenge as a stabilizing and proactive force


during the exciting transition period ahead.
