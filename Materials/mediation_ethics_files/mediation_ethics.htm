<br><a NAME="Introduction"></a><b>Introduction</b>
<p>The practice of law has been enhanced by the relatively recent addition
of alternative dispute resolution. While alternative dispute resolution
encompasses a range of different practices, mediation constitutes a large,
popular and growing segment of the field. Some practitioners advocate mediation
as a better form of dispute resolution than litigation and other alternative
dispute resolution methods. [<a href="#1">FN1</a>] Mediation is a non-adversarial
process whereby two or more disputants cooperate with a third-party neutral
to reach agreement by and among themselves. [<a href="#2">FN2</a>] Attorneys
are ever more frequently participating in the practice of mediation either
as advocates for one of the disputants or as third-party neutrals. Today,
some attorneys mediate as a full time occupation and for many more attorneys
mediation is a significant part of their professional practice. [<a href="#3.">FN3</a>]
<p>One of the fundamental indicia of a profession is the existence and
enforcement of a professional code of ethics. The profession of law is
no exception. [<a href="#4">FN4</a>] Today, there is substantial uncertainty
as to what, if any, professional standards of ethics apply to attorney-mediators
acting as third-party neutrals. [<a href="#5">FN5</a>] Where the practice
of mediation has become a considerable part of many attorneys trade, it
is important for the organized bar and for members of the bar to know whether
existing legal standards of ethics apply to this practice or whether some
other standards apply or perhaps no standards at all. [<a href="#6">FN6</a>]
<p>The American Bar Association has recently participated in the drafting
of a proposed uniform standard of ethics to apply to third-party neutrals
who mediate. [<a href="#7">FN7</a>] However these standards have neither
been publicized nor adopted by the House of Delegates of the American Bar
Association. Furthermore, standards of ethics adopted by the American Bar
Association have no force and effect until and unless adopted by the state
body regulating lawyers and the practice of law. [<a href="#8">FN8</a>]
Therefore, it is appropriate at this time to contemplate the issues involved
in forging standards of ethics for attorney-mediators because this debate
is only beginning. [<a href="#9">FN9</a>]
<p>Part I of this paper explores the relationship between mediation from
other dispute resolution methods and outlines activities which attorney-mediators
engage in that may create special professional obligations toward disputants.
Part II frames the ethical dilemmas surrounding the role and scope of confidentiality,
self-determination and legal representation in the special case of the
attorney-mediator. Part III details several examples of mediator ethical
dilemmas and describes the various issues in each. Part IV critiques the
existing standards of ethics governing or purporting to govern attorney-mediator,
concluding that they are deficient. Part V then applies the general principles
underlying ethics codes critiqued in Part IV, as well as other standards,
to varius ethics scenarios. Through systematic analysis, it is posited
that reforms to attorney-mediator ethical standards should emphasize the
importance of client self-determination, not just in decision making within
the process, but also stressing the right to determine the process itself.
Such rights should include the right to determine what type and scope of
legal skills shall be incorporated into the process by the attorney-mediator.
Finally, Part VI, the conclusion, summarizes and synthesizes the prior
analysis and argues for difinitive American Bar Association action.
<p><a NAME="I. The Special Role of Mediation in Dispute"></a><b>I. The
Special Role of Mediation in Dispute Resolution</b>
<p>It is important to explore the role of mediation among dispute resolution
methods to understand what special demands it makes of the attorney practitioner.
The major formal dispute resolution methods include litigation, arbitration,
negotiation and mediation. [<a href="#10">FN10</a>] Certain other practices,
such as the mini-trial, neutral evaluation and various hybrids of dispute
resolution methods exist, but account for relatively little activity of
lawyers and will not be discussed here.
<p>The first significant division among these methods is between litigation
and the rest. Unlike non-adversarial mediation, litigation is an adversarial
process wherein the disputants vie against each other under the auspices
of a formal judicial proceeding for the purpose of winning. [<a href="#11">FN11</a>]
Typically, disputants engaged in litigation are represented by counsel.
The rules of evidence and the jurisdictional body of law are applied by
the counsel in advocacy of her clients position. Litigation is the traditional
and accepted method of formal dispute resolution used by attorneys. The
traditional role of the litigator is to zealously advocate the interests
of the client. [<a href="#12">FN12</a>]
<p>The other formal dispute resolution methods are categorized as alternative
dispute resolution. Within the last several years alternative dispute resolution
has gained wide acceptance as providing additional valuable ways to solve
disputes. [<a href="#13">FN13</a>] Alternative dispute resolution methods
are touted as often being faster, less expensive and less adversarial than
litigation. Unlike litigation, alternative dispute resolution is not subject
to the rules of court, thus relieving the participants from the necessity
of potentially costly and time consuming discovery, interrogatories, depositions,
wasted time/opportunity costs and the attendant lawyers bills consequent
to in-court representation. [<a href="#14">FN14</a>] Indeed, alternative
dispute resolution has been heralded by some as a good "substitute" for
litigation because it "benefits the clients, the courts and society to
a greater extent than complete adjudication." [<a href="#15">FN15</a>]
<p>As among alternative dispute resolution methods, the second important
division is between arbitration and negotiation, which belong in one category,
and mediation, belonging in another. Both arbitration and negotiation are
based on an adversarial model. While neither method need be hostile, the
philosophy underlying each approach is that each party will apply tself
to the process for maximum gain. It can be argued that the use of "principled
negotiation" practices obviates the need for such positional advocacy by
inviting all participant to care for each others interests. [<a href="#16">FN16</a>]
However, existing standards of ethics for lawyers require putting the clients
interests above the interests of the adversary or a third-party. [<a href="#17">FN17</a>]
<p>The undeniable similarity between a mediator and an arbitrator is that
each must be absolutely impartial and neutral at all times and to all parties.
[<a href="#18">FN18</a>] Thus, it is widely recognized that the attorney-mediator
and attorney-arbitrator must substitute for the ethical duty of zealous
or diligent representation a duty of impartiality. [<a href="#19">FN19</a>]
The traditional role of an arbitrator is to sit as an adjudicatory authority,
to have the dispute submitted to her and to render a decision. [<a href="#20">FN20</a>]
This is the classic third-party neutral role. As will be shown, the differences
between the role of attorney-mediator and attorney-arbitrator can result
in different professional demands.
<p>Mediation, by definition, requires the parties to cooperate together
in a non-adversarial process to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement.
The emphasis in mediation is on compromise and agreement, not on individual
success. As regards the appropriate role of an attorney, the attorney-mediator
fills a substantively different slot than the attorney-negotiator (advocate)
or attorney-arbitrator (adjudicator). Clearly, the mediator is not the
advocate of any one participant nor the passive adjudicator of an ultimate
decision (whether binding or not). A mediator, by contrast, is an active
participant in the problem solving process and interacts with all participants
so as to promote an agreement beneficial to all participants. [<a href="#21">FN21</a>]
<p>Customary mediator practices include: eliciting facts; defining the
issues, leading the parties through brainstorming sessions, helping to
generate options, helping to asses and select options, identifying objective
standards of fairness, breaking through impasse, documenting and finalizing
agreements, and potentially representing the agreement in a court. [<a href="#22">FN22</a>]
Such involvement can create a special relationship between the attorney-mediator
and the disputants whereby the attorney is, in practice, exercising her
professional judgment on behalf of the interests of multiple parties with
conflicting interests. [<a href="#23">FN23</a>]
<p>The possibility of forming a lawyer-client-like relationship is particularly
great where the attorney frames the law as applied to the specific facts
put forward by disputants, communicates a legal evaluation, or drafts legal
documents. [<a href="#24">FN24</a>] Such a relationship avoids ethical
problems where the attorney acts as an advocate for a client in a negotiation,
an arbitration or a mediation because the attorney-advocate is bound to
comport with the ordinary rules of conduct requiring zealous or diligent
representation of her client. Likewise, where the attorney acts as an arbitrator,
the applicable standards of conduct for an impartial and detached third-party
neutral should control. [<a href="#25">FN25</a>] However, the fundamental
difference between the role of arbitrator (one to whom parties submit their
dispute for resolution) and a mediator (one with whom the disputants work
to reach agreement for themselves) suggest the need for different standards
of ethics. [<a href="#26">FN26</a>]
<p><a NAME="II. Exploration of Attorney-Mediators Ethical"></a><b>II. Exploration
of Attorney-Mediator Ethical Challenges</b>
<p><a NAME="A. Confidentiality and"></a><b>A. Confidentiality and Self-Determination</b>
<p>It is generally agreed that mediators should uphold the ethical principles
of confidentiality and client self-determination. [<a href="#27">FN27</a>]
However, there is disagreement as to the contours and content of these
terms. The confusion as to precisely what ethical standards govern attorney-mediators
is well recognized by scholarly commentators in the legal profession. [<a href="#28">FN28</a>]
It is unclear to whom confidentiality ought to be owed (just private one-on-one
communications with a disputant or all communications in a mediation?)
and what exceptions to confidentiality operate (must abuse be disclosed?
[<a href="#29">FN29</a>]). [<a href="#30">FN30</a>] The existing standards
of ethics for attorneys provide clear guidance on the question of confidentiality.
[<a href="#31">FN31</a>] But, these standards are premised on an attorney
relationship with a single client. Application of attorney-client confidentiality
to multiple clients is problematic at best, impossible at worst. [<a href="#32">FN32</a>]
<p>Even less clear is the proper ethical balance between the principle
of client self-determination on one hand and, on the other, the rendering
of legal advice, legal drafting, legal evaluation and representation. There
are many attorney-mediators who take for granted the precept that rendering
legal services in the context of a mediation is unethical. [<a href="#33">FN33</a>]
Some think self-determination by clients is incompatible with rendering
professional advice by the attorney-mediator. [<a href="#34">FN34</a>]
This issue arises most often where the mediator is also a licensed professional
in the fields of therapy or law. However, another central principle in
mediation is to assure the participants make decisions based on adequate
information. [<a href="#35">FN35</a>] In the case of an attorney-mediator
who is asked a relevant question of law requiring her professional legal
judgment, her failure to respond may, in effect, deprive the disputant(s)
adequate information on which to base their decision.
<p>The lawyer's customary duties of confidentiality, representing client
interests and assuring adequacy of information are activated when a lawyer
practices law on behalf of another. [<a href="#36">FN36</a>] However, whether
mediation constitutes the practice of law is itself at issue. [<a href="#37">FN37</a>]
Thus, analysis and resolution of the above ethical dilemmas requires an
exploration of the relationship between mediation and the practice of law.
<p><a NAME="B. The Relationship Between the Practice of Law"></a><b>B.
The Relationship Between the Practice of Law and Mediation</b>
<p>For the attorney-mediator, a seminal issue is whether her conduct is
governed by the disciplinary ethics standards of a bar association. Some
scholars assert that mediation is not the practice of law - thus not subject
to ethics codes. [<a href="#38">FN38</a>] As noted above, some practitioners
earnestly believe they do not practice law when they mediate. Furthermore,
many non-bar dispute resolution organizations prohibit or discourage the
practice of law by mediators in their standard of ethics. [<a href="#39">FN39</a>]
However, some scholars posit that lawyers should and do practice law when
they mediate. [<a href="#40">FN40</a>] Some bar associations have explicitly
recognized mediation to be the practice of law and encouraged lawyers to
run mediation clinics from their law offices. [<a href="#41">FN41</a>]
Malpractice insurance for lawyers now covers mediation. [<a href="#42">FN42</a>]
Furthermore, even if mediation were finally determined not to be the practice
of law when conducted by an attorney, that attorney may remain subject
to state bar disciplinary authority anyway because mediation is related
to law. [<a href="#43">FN43</a>] As the following examples point out, it
is necessary for attorneys who mediate often do not know to what standard
they will be held.
<p><a NAME="III. Examples of Actual Ethical Dilemmas Faced by"></a><b>III.
Examples of Actual Ethical Dilemmas Faced by Mediators</b>
<p>The uncertainty of mediators over the scope of confidentiality, role
of self-determination and proper extent of professional assistance in mediation
was highlighted in a recent study of mediators conducted by Robert A. Baruch
Bush. [<a href="#44">FN44</a>] Professor Bush compiled information on ethical
dilemmas faced by mediators. The examples provided are based on actual,
not hypothetical, situations experienced by the mediators surveyed. The
following examples from Professor Bush's study include, where appropriate,
the reasons why responding mediator felt the situation presented an ethical
dilemma. These examples shall be used to test the advisability of various
possible ethical rules for attorney-mediators to be discussed later in
this paper.
<p><a NAME="A. Situations Involving"></a><b>A. Situations Involving Confidentiality</b>
<p>Typical confidentiality dilemmas include example #1, where an agreement
is about to be reached that the other party would probably not accept if
the confidential information were disclosed. and, #2, where disclosure
of the confidential information would probably convince both parties to
reach a good settlement, and, otherwise, no settlement is sure.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><b>Example #1</b>
<br>In a business mediation over repayment of a loan, the parties agree
to a settlement in which one of the major items is assignment to Lender
of an interest in a lawsuit Borrower has filed against a third party. Borrower
tells the mediator confidentially that the lawsuit is somewhat tenuous
and that he may not even have enough funds to carry through with it, though
he hopes to. Assuming Borrower says flatly that he does not want the other
party to know this, and resists any suggestion to disclose the information
himself, should the mediator disclose it, or else discontinue the mediation?
If the latter, would this not be a form of disclosure in itself? Should
the mediator, therefore, simply maintain the confidence and proceed, no
matter what? If so, confidentiality is preserved, but at the expense of
the values of consent and fairness.
<p><b>Example #2</b>
<br>In a personal injury case, the bottom lines of the two parties, as
communicated to the mediator in caucus, overlap. Injurer tells the mediator
that he would go as high as $40,000; Victim says he will take as little
as $30,000. The mediator knows that "a figure in the middle will leave
everyone happy," and that all she has to do is to suggest it to wrap things
up.</blockquote>

<p><br><a NAME="B. Situations Involving Neutral"></a><b>B. Situations Involving
Neutral Evaluations</b>
<p>Other issues are raised where the mediator is asked to make a binding
evaluation of one contentious issue in a mediation, as in example #3 or
asked to make a non-binding recommendation as in example #4.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><b>Example #3</b>
<br>In a divorce mediation, all issues have been settled except one--the
value of a business that is a major asset of the marriage and must be valued
in order for the property settlement to be finalized. The parties simply
cannot agree, after much discussion, on a figure. They turn to the mediator
and ask her to make a decision, which they will accept as binding, on what
the value of the business is in dollar terms. Should the mediator agree
to decide this issue for the parties, especially since they have specifically
requested it? Or should the mediator refuse to take on a decisional role,
even at the parties' request? If the mediator accepts, she guarantees the
settlement of the dispute, but she takes control of the outcome from the
parties' hands, seemingly undermining the value of self-determination.
However, since this taking of control is specifically requested by the
parties, perhaps it does not conflict with self-determination. Nevertheless,
if the parties know that the mediator can be called upon at some point
to simply decide the outcome, this knowledge may undermine both the potential
for self-determination and the confidence in the mediator's complete impartiality
as regards outcome.
<p><b>Example #4</b>
<br>In the mediation of a business contract dispute, plaintiff originally
claims $200,000 damages and defendant offers to pay $75,000. After three
hours of discussion, the parties are stalled at 150 versus 110, $40,000
apart. No further progress is produced by caucuses, etc. The parties ask
the mediator to tell them his opinion as to what would be a reasonable
settlement, based on what he has heard. That is, they ask for a mediator's
recommendation. Should the mediator give one or not? The question is similar
to that above, with the difference that, since a recommendation would not
be binding, there is both less risk of imposition and less certainty of
settlement. However, the risk to perceptions of impartiality may be even
greater, especially if the recommendation will lead to further discussion.</blockquote>

<p><br><a NAME="C. Situations Involving Power"></a><b>C. Situations Involving
Power Imbalance</b>
<p>Another category of ethical dilemmas is comprised of situations where
one party is taken advantage of or actually bullied as in example #5. This
situation is exacerbated where the bullying disputant asserts groundless
legal arguments in support of his position as in example #6. An interesting
variant on this theme occurs where the power imbalance is between lawyers
of the disputants, as in example #7.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><b>Example #5</b>
<br>In a divorce mediation, with no lawyers present, Wife is a middle-aged
woman who has never worked outside the home or dealt with complex economic
issues, instead deferring to Husband for this. Now, Husband, a business
executive, is taking advantage of this to dictate terms of a property settlement
to Wife, and she is prepared to accept. If Wife had any knowledge of such
matters, she would realize the terms are grossly unfair to her.
<p><b>Example #6</b>
<br>In a divorce mediation, Husband, a construction worker, states that
he built the family house himself and, therefore, it is legally his own
personal property. He is adamant about this, and Wife, who seems uncertain
of her ground and intimidated by him, is prepared to accept this claim
and give Husband the house, although there is little other property to
divide. The mediator sees that Wife is being bullied, and knows that Husband's
legal argument is absolutely groundless.
<p><b>Example #7</b>
<br>In a personal injury mediation, the mediator sees that Victim's attorney
is preparing to settle for half the value of what is clearly a solid $500,000
claim, primarily because the other attorney is a far better advocate and
negotiator. The Victim's attorney has misread both the Injurer's attorney
and his own case, and so has grabbed at a low initial offer. Injurer's
attorney, realizing the situation, has capitalized on it and is nailing
down the unfair settlement.</blockquote>

<p><br><a NAME="D. Situations Calling for Advice on Fairness and"></a><b>D.
Situations Calling for Advice on Fairness and Legality</b>
<p>The mediator may be called upon by one disputant to comment on the legality
or fairness of a potential agreement, as in examples #8 and #9, or she
may have formed an unsolicited conclusion as to the legality or fairness
of matters under discussion which would be material to the informed decision
of one disputant as in examples #10 and #11.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><b>Example #8</b>
<br>In a divorce mediation, Husband is asserting that Wife's heart condition
automatically makes her legally unfit to be the primary custodian of the
children. Wife asks the mediator if this is so. The mediator, an experienced
divorce attorney, knows to a certainty that Husband is wrong about the
legal rule.
<p><b>Example #9</b>
<br>In a divorce mediation, Wife has received a property settlement offer
from Husband that, in the mediator's opinion, is a very generous offer.
Wife asks the mediator whether she thinks it is a good deal.
<p><b>Example #10</b>
<br>In a community mediation between an employer and employee over alleged
damage of merchandise by Employee, Employer threatens to withhold wages
unless Employee pays for the damage. Employee says Employer has no right
to do so. The mediator, a lawyer, knows that withholding wages is illegal
unless pursuant to a wage garnishing action in court.
<p><b>Example #11</b>
<br>In a personal injury mediation, Victim is about to refuse an offer
from Injurer that, in the mediator's opinion, is as much as or more than
Victim is likely to get if the case actually goes to trial. Victim does
not ask for the mediator's opinion, but there is still time to offer it
before the refusal is voiced.</blockquote>

<p><br><a NAME="IV. Critique of Current Ethical"></a><b>IV. Critique of
Current Ethical Standards</b>
<p><a NAME="A. The Model Code of Professional"></a><b>A. The Model Code
of Professional Responsibility</b>
<p>The American Bar Association Model Code of Professional Responsibility
(the Code) is ill-suited to the practice of attorney led mediation. [<a href="#45">FN45</a>]
It is evident that the Code was not drafted with mediation in mind. It
is all but impossible to apply the Code's over-arching requirement of zealousness
to an attorney-mediator who is bound to be impartial. [<a href="#46">FN46</a>]
The Code neither prohibits nor provides direction for attorney-mediators
seeking mediation guidelines.
<p>The Code is comprised of Disciplinary Rules (D.R.) and Ethical Considerations
(E.C.). [<a href="#47">FN47</a>] Violation of a D.R. is grounds for disciplinary
action by state bar authorities. The E.C.s serve as merely aspirational
non-mandatory ideals. Lawyers often pay much closer attention to the D.R.s
and less to the E.C.s. [<a href="#48">FN48</a>] Unfortunately, there are
several D.R.s which render mediation ethically risky and only one E.C.
which seems to encourage mediation. E.C. 5-20 seems to supply support for
the permissibility of mediation practice by attorneys. E.C. 5-20 reads:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>A lawyer is often asked to serve as an impartial arbitrator
or mediator in matters which involve present or former clients. He may
serve in either capacity if he first discloses such present or former relationships.
After a lawyer has undertaken to act as an impartial arbitrator or mediator,
he should not thereafter represent in the dispute any of the parties involved.
[<a href="#49">FN49</a>]</blockquote>

<p><br>However, E.C. 5-20 has been overshadowed by several D.R.s which
seem to restrict mediation. For example, D.R. 5-105(C) permits multiple
representation only "if it is obvious that [the lawyer] can adequately
represent the interests of each and if each consents to the representation
after full disclosure of the possible effect of such representation on
the exercise of [the lawyers] independent professional judgment on behalf
of each." [<a href="#50">FN50</a>] Among the problems for would-be attorney-mediators
is attempting to determine when it is "obvious" that each of the disputants'
divergent interests can be "adequately" represented.
<p>Likewise, D.R. 5-105 requires the lawyer to decline or discontinue employment
that is likely to (1) adversely affect her exercise of independent judgment
on behalf of a client or (2) to involve her in representing differing interests.
[<a href="#51">FN51</a>] D.R. 5-105 would seem to all but close the possibility
of disciplinary-free mediation apparently opened by E.C. 5-20. State ethics
committees have interpreted the Code to prohibit mediation or severely
restrict it. [<a href="#52">FN52</a>] In Maryland, a lawyer may not serve
as an "impartial advisory attorney" in a mediation if there is a risk of
impairment of her independent judgment or unauthorized law practice. [<a href="#53">FN53</a>]
Wisconsin has found it to be an irresolvable conflict for an attorney to
be a legal advisor to a divorce mediation. [<a href="#54">FN54</a>] Similarly,
a 1972 New Jersey ethics committee holding prohibited lawyers from representing
both the buyer and seller in a real estate transaction in any phase of
the preparation or execution of the sales agreement. [<a href="#55">FN55</a>]
<p><a NAME="B. The Model Rules of Professional"></a><b>B. The Model Rules
of Professional Conduct</b>
<p>The American Bar Association replaced the Code with the Model Rules
of Professional Conduct (the Rules) in 1983. In states where they have
been adopted, the Rules serve as the basis of state ethics standards for
lawyers. The Rules reformulated the ethical guidelines governing representation
of multiple clients with adverse interests. [<a href="#56">FN56</a>] Rule
2.2 sets forth a relatively precise set of standards for the attorney to
meet, including under what conditions representation is proper, when representation
is improper and the need to keep all client adequately informed. The text
of Rule 2.2 reads as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>MODEL RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT (1992).
<br>Model Rule 2.2:
<br>(a) A lawyer may act as intermediary between clients if:
<p>(1) the lawyer consults with each client concerning the implications
of the common representation, including the advantages and risks involved,
and the effect on the attorney-client privileges, and obtains each client's
consent to the common representation;
<p>(2) the lawyer reasonably believes that the matter can be resolved on
terms compatible with the clients' best interests, that each client will
be able to make adequately informed decisions in the matter and that there
is little risk of material prejudice to the interests of any of the clients
if the contemplated resolution is unsuccessful; and
<p>(3) the lawyer reasonably believes that the common representation can
be undertaken impartially and without improper effect on other responsibilities
the lawyer has to any of the clients.
<p>(b) While acting as intermediary, the lawyer shall consult with each
client concerning the decisions to be made and the considerations relevant
in making them, so that each client can make adequately informed decisions.
<p>(c) A lawyer shall withdraw as intermediary if any of the clients so
requests, or if any of the conditions stated in paragraph (a) is no longer
satisfied. Upon withdrawal, the lawyer shall not continue to represent
any of the clients in the matter that was the subject of the intermediation.</blockquote>

<p><br>Unfortunately, Rule 2.2, while facially applicable to mediators,
is defined not to apply to mediation in the comment to the rule. The comment
states:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>The Rule does not apply to a lawyer acting as arbitrator or
mediator between or among parties who are not clients of the lawyer, even
where the lawyer has been appointed with the concurrence of the parties.
[<a href="#57">FN57</a>]</blockquote>

<p><br>The comment goes on to suggest that the attorney-mediator, while
not subject to the constraints of Rule 2.2, may fall under the purview
of another "applicable" code of ethics. The comment states:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>In performing such a role the lawyer may be subject to applicable
codes of ethics, such as the Code of Ethics for Arbitration in Commercial
Disputes prepared by a joint Committee of the American Bar Association
and the American Arbitration Association. [<a href="#58">FN58</a>]</blockquote>

<p><br>This language has led many scholars to conclude that the Rules do
not apply to attorney-mediators. [<a href="#59">FN59</a>] However, other
scholars have used the term "intermediary" and "mediator" interchangeably
and argue that Rule 2.2 does apply to attorney-mediators. [<a href="#60">FN60</a>]
It is generally recognized, however, that Rule 2.2 does not apply to attorney-mediators.
[<a href="#61">FN61</a>] In fact, based on the assumption that Rule 2.2
does not apply to attorney-mediators, in 1991 the A.B.A. Standing Committee
on Dispute Resolution determined that the suggestion that attorney-mediators
look to other codes of conduct beyond the Rule was "inadequate, owing to
the significantly to the enormous growth in alternative dispute resolution
processes generally and to the increasing use of mediation in particular."
[<a href="#62">FN62</a>]
<p><a NAME="C. Other Ethics Guidelines for"></a><b>C. Other Ethics Guidelines
for Mediators</b>
<p>There are two relevant categories of other ethics codes for mediators:
first, codes designed to apply to attorneys only; and, second, codes designed
to apply to all mediators, including attorneys. Mediator codes share certain
provisions, including the centrality of neutrality and impartiality, the
importance of confidentiality, admonitions against contingency fees, and
the need to describe the process of mediation to disputants in advance.
[<a href="#63">FN63</a>] Codes designed for attorneys also typically have
provisions requiring that the giving of legal information, if it is to
be given at all, must occur in the presence of all parties, that the lawyer
may not represent any one disputant subsequently in the same matter as
was the subject of the mediation;, and that the attorney must describe
the difference between mediation and traditional attorney-client representation.
[<a href="#64">FN64</a>]
<p><a NAME="1. Ethics of Legal Advice or"></a><b>1. Ethics of Legal Advice
or Information</b>
<p>The above mentioned similarities, however, fail to resolve substantial
conflicts in the treatment of the proper role of legal practice as performed
by the mediator for the disputants. There are some codes which would absolutely
prohibit attorney-mediators from rendering professional legal advice to
disputants. For instance, the Center for Dispute Resolution Code of Conduct
states:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>Mediators are not lawyers. At no time shall a mediator offer
legal advice to parties in dispute. Mediators shall refer parties to appropriate
attorneys for legal advice. This same code of conduct applies to mediators
who are themselves trained in the law. The role of an impartial mediator
should not be confused with that of an attorney who is an advocate for
a client. [<a href="#65">FN65</a>]</blockquote>

<p><br>This provision of the Center for Dispute Resolution Code of Conduct
has been criticized for being in "direct conflict with the cost reduction
goals achieved through lawyers' involvement in mediation as facilitators
using their attendant legal expertise." [<a href="#66">FN66</a>] Nevertheless,
several scholarly proposed codes of conduct retain an absolute ban against
legal advice for attorney-mediators. [<a href="#67">FN67</a>]
<p>Other codes seem to hedge on the permissibility of legal advice by attorney-mediators.
For instance, the American Bar Association Standards of Practice for Lawyer
Mediators in Family Disputes (A.B.A. Standards of Practice) requires the
mediator to assure that the disputants make decisions based on "sufficient
information and knowledge" but prohibits any legal advice or description
clearer than what is necessary to "define the legal issue." [<a href="#68">FN68</a>]
Specifically, Standard IV(c) states:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>The mediator may define the legal issues, but shall not direct
the decision of the mediation participants based upon the mediator's interpretation
of the law as applied to the facts of the situation. The mediator shall
endeavor to assure that the participants have a sufficient understanding
of appropriate statutory and case law as well as local judicial tradition,
before reaching an agreement by recommending to the participants that they
obtain independent legal representation during the process. [<a href="#69">FN69</a>]</blockquote>

<p><br>It is unclear how precisely the legal issues can be framed to suit
the questions and needs of the parties. There is no explanation of whether
the attorney-mediator is to provide more detailed information when a disputant
does not receive independent counsel as a remedy for insufficient understanding.
It is also unclear whether, under the letter of this provision, a mediator
may provide an interpretation of the law as applied to the facts of the
situation where she does not "direct the decision" of the disputants based
on her interpretation. Such a possibility seems an obvious loophole allowing
for the provision of legal advice.
<p>Still another Section of the American Bar Association has also demonstrated
uncertainty over the proper role of legal information as provided by an
attorney-mediator. The American Bar Association Section on Dispute Resolution
proposed a rule which, as of 1993, actually contained two substantively
different options for the section dealing with legal information. [<a href="#70">FN70</a>]
The section reads:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>(c) If either of the parties do not have independent legal
counsel, the lawyer-mediator shall give legal information to a party only
in the presence of all parties in the matter. The lawyer-mediator shall
advise unrepresented parties or those parties whose independent counsel
does not accompany them about the importance of reviewing the lawyer-mediator's
legal information with an independent counsel.
<br>(c) The lawyer-mediator shall advise those parties whose counsel does
not accompany them about the importance of reviewing the lawyer-mediator's
legal information with such counsel. [<a href="#71">FN71</a>]</blockquote>

<p><br>Evidently the proposal is meant to resolve the issue over the propriety
of legal advice by labeling such communication as "legal information."
<p>The distinction is without a difference in the situations which the
rule was meant to address. As has been noted in scholarly journals, the
mere framing of a legal issue, particularly when framed by an attorney,
is not a neutral activity. [<a href="#72">FN72</a>] Rather, as put by one
scholar: "just by raising some legal principles [s]he feels are relevant
(and omitting others [s]he feels are not) the mediator is applying law
to specific facts, and in the process may benefit one party at the expense
of another." [<a href="#73">FN73</a>]
<p><a NAME="2. Ethics of"></a><b>2. Ethics of Confidentiality</b>
<p>The proper scope of confidentiality within mediation is at issue among
the codes and in the scholarly literature. There is substantial agreement
regarding the need for confidentiality as between the parties to a mediation
and all others outside the mediation. [<a href="#74">FN74</a>] However,
there is sharp disagreement about whether confidentiality should exist
as between disputants. The proper exceptions to confidentiality outside
the mediation will not be discussed here.
<p>For example, the code of ethics for attorney-mediators proposed by commentator
Sandra E. Purnell would require disclosure of all intra-mediation communication
by and to all disputants. [<a href="#75">FN75</a>] The Purnell code, at
I.D, states:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>Before beginning the mediation process, the mediator must:
<br>Obtain an agreement from both parties that all information disclosed
during mediation will be kept confidential as to any non-participants but
will be disclosed to each participant. [<a href="#76">FN76</a>]</blockquote>

<p><br>By way of contrast, the code proposed by commentator Robert Bush
would require a veil of secrecy over all private communications between
a disputant and the mediator unless consented to by the confiding disputant.
[<a href="#77">FN77</a>] The Bush' code, at Standard III.D. states:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>A mediator is absolutely obligated not to disclose, directly
or indirectly, to any party to mediation, information communicated to the
mediator in confidence by any other party, unless that party gives permission
to do so. [<a href="#78">FN78</a>]</blockquote>

<p><br>The Society of Professionals in Dispute Resolution Ethical Standards
of Professional Conduct (SPIDR Standards) require, at Standard B.6, that
"a commitment by the neutral to hold information in confidence within the
process also must be honored." [<a href="#79">FN79</a>] This treatment
rather begs the question of whether there is any pre-existing (or default)
duty to hold such communication in confidence. Apparently there is not.
<p><a NAME="3. Ethics of Assuring Fairness in Result and"></a><b>3. Ethics
of Assuring Fairness in Result and Equality in Bargaining</b>
<p>The codes promulgated by dispute organizations seem to reject any affirmative
duty by the mediator to assure the substantive fairness of the result of
a mediation in favor of a mere duty to raise question about the fairness.
For instance, the A.B.A. Standards of Practice state at Standard III(c):
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>The mediator must be impartial as between the mediation participants.
The mediator's full task is to facilitate the ability of the participants
to negotiate their own agreement, while raising questions as to the fairness,
equity and feasibility of proposed options for settlement. [<a href="#80">FN80</a>]</blockquote>

<p><br>Similarly, the SPIDR Standards state, in part, at Standard B(6):
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>The neutral has a responsibility to see that the parties consider
the terms of a settlement. If the neutral is concerned about the possible
consequences of a proposed agreement, and the needs of the parties dictate,
the neutral must inform the parties of that concern. In adhering to this
standard the neutral may find it advisable to educate the parties, to refer
one or more parties for specialized advice, or to withdraw from the case.
[<a href="#81">FN81</a>]</blockquote>

<p><br>This section would certainly permit significant integration of the
mediators opinion of fairness into the mediation process. The charged term
"educate" rather than a more neutral word, such as "communicate" or "indicate"
appears to give broader license to the mediator to exact a measure of agreement
from the parties about her opinion concerning "possible" results or else
the mediator can withdraw.
<p>An example of a scrupulously non-interventionist code is the Joint Committee's
Standards of Conduct for Mediators (the Joint Committee's Standards). [<a href="#82">FN82</a>]
The Joint Committee's Standards were proposed in April, 1994 by representatives
from the American Bar Association, the American Arbitration Association
and the Society of Professionals in Dispute Resolution. Standard VI states,
in part:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>A quality process requires a commitment by the mediator to
diligence and procedural fairness. There should be adequate opportunity
for each party in the mediation to participate in the discussions. [Comments]
. . . A mediator shall withdraw from the mediation or postpone a session
if the mediation is being used to further illegal conduct or if a party
is unable to participate due to drug, alcohol or other physical or mental
incapacity. [<a href="#83">FN83</a>]</blockquote>

<p><br>Thus, under this code, a mediator need not withdraw due to substantive
unfairness in the agreement, but only when the process is unfair or illegal.
Evidently, so long as disputant A and B both have equal time to talk they
need not have equal justice. What is left unaddressed is whether the mediator
is permitted to communicate observed unfairness in the agreement or to
withdraw as a result of same or whether she must grind through a fair process
producing a legal, sober, thoroughly discussed yet unconscionable resultant
agreement.
<p>Among scholarly mediator ethicists, however, there is deep disagreement
as to whether a mediator has a duty to protect a weaker disputant from
being exploited and to assure substantive fairness. Under the Purnell code,
bargaining equality and fairness of the agreement are made absolute rules
of conduct, rendering failure to comply "grounds to discontinue mediation
and [to] make any agreement reached unenforceable." [<a href="#84">FN84</a>]
At Rule II. B and D, the Purnell code states:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><b>B. Equality in Bargaining. </b>Neither party will be permitted
to take advantage of the other; the mediator will intervene when necessary
to prevent either party from dominating discussion, coercing, threatening,
or intimidating the other party, or otherwise creating an imbalance in
the interaction.
<p><b>D. Fairness.</b> The parties will attempt to reach an agreement that
they consider to be fair to themselves and that complies with legal standards
of fairness to themselves and to third parties. In addition, if the parties
reach any tentative agreements that the mediator considers seriously unfair,
she will inform the parties of her opinion and the reasons for it. Should
the parties commit themselves to an agreement that the mediator considers
substantially unfair, she shall be free to withdraw from the mediation.
[<a href="#85">FN85</a>]</blockquote>

<p><br>Commentator Judith Maute, in her proposed code at (c)1-3 would only
require the attorney-mediator to make an independent assessment of the
fairness of an agreement where the parties are not separately represented,
and then only severe inequity will suffice to prevent finalization. [<a href="#86">FN86</a>]
The relevant section states:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>(c) When the parties are not separately represented, the mediator
may prepare a written agreement resolving the dispute subject to the following
conditions:
<br>(1) the terms approximate a likely adjudicated outcome, or the parties
are adequately informed and voluntarily agree to different terms;
<br>(2) the parties are informed of their right to seek independent legal
advice, and urged to do so when the agreement addresses important legal
rights;
<br>(3) the lawyer may not knowingly finalize an agreement reasonably believed
to be illegal, grossly inequitable, or based on false information. [<a href="#87">FN87</a>]</blockquote>

<p><br><a NAME="V. The Proper Role of Attorneys and Law in"></a><b>V. The
Proper Role of Attorneys and Law in Mediation</b>
<p>The sampling of actual ethical dilemmas set out in Part III above serve
to point out the problems inherent in establishing a set of per se rules
governing the previous situations. The situations involving confidentiality
demonstrate the inadvisability of a rule which would compel intra-mediation
disclosure against the will of the mediation participants. Clearly, in
example #1 the Borrower would resist a process which exposed his confidence,
thus tending to de-legitimize the mediation process itself. On the other
hand, where the mediator can help the disputants to settle within what
(s)he knows to be a mutually acceptable range, then the essential purpose
of mediation is served. [<a href="#88">FN88</a>] Thus, a per se rule prohibiting
any such disclosure would likewise be undesirable where it serves to defeat
the parties interests and expectations.
<p>The attempted compromise embodied in the Joint Committee's Standards
is a step in the right direction. The Joint Committee's Standards, at Standard
V., suggest "a mediators shall maintain the reasonable expectations of
the parties with regard to confidentiality." [<a href="#89">FN89</a>] This
code correctly identifies the need for flexibility in confidentiality,
but fails to provide sufficient guidance to the mediator or information
to the disputant on what considerations to take into account and when.
The code merely states that the expectations of the parties "depend on
the circumstances and any agreements they make" and that "the mediator
should discuss these expectations with the parties." [<a href="#90">FN90</a>]
<p>The better rule is one which provides flexibility, but requires definite
understanding, [<a href="#91">FN91</a>] as reached by the disputants, at
the outset [<a href="#92">FN92</a>] as to what rules shall govern. The
requirement of pre-mediation determination (as opposed to possibly having
to argue later about the "circumstances") preserves party autonomy without
jeopardizing certainty in the process. In addition, if the parties agree
in advance, for instance, to keep all private in-caucus communications
strictly confidential regardless of materiality, then no ethical issue
is raised in situations such as example #1. The right measure by which
to determine whether multiple representation is proper in a mediation is
the "client's understanding of [and consent to] the mediation process."
[<a href="#93">FN93</a>] Where a mediator with strict personal morality
would find it personally impossible to conduct such a mediation, then she
need not agree to mediate between parties requesting those procedural terms.
The principle is that the decision initially and ultimately should belong
to mediators, not to the bar association (as enforced through a code) or
the individual mediator.
<p>Similarly, disputants in situations involving evaluations, legal advice
and representation are ill-served by rigid rules prohibiting lawyers from
offering lawyering skills in the mediation context. [<a href="#94">FN94</a>]
Future disputants stand to lose vital, timely, fair and cost-effective
legal services should such a ban take effect. [<a href="#95">FN95</a>]
It is in the interests of lawyers and the organized bar to meet the next
wave of dispute resolution boldly, by allowing integration of the special
talents of lawyering into mediation when the parties so desire. As with
confidentiality, the decision as to what type and how much lawyering to
be permitted in a given mediation ought to be left up to the parties to
the greatest practicable extent. Indeed, many parties seek a lawyer to
mediate their dispute precisely because they expect the benefit of supporting
legal skills. [<a href="#96">FN96</a>]
<p>Again, the Joint Committee's Standards hold out some promise of a good
resolution only - to dash these hopes in the next sentence. Unfortunately,
the tone of these standards is unduly hostile to the potentially beneficial
role of professionalism where consented to by informed disputants in a
mediation. In this respect, the standards admonish mediators "to refrain
from providing professional advice." [<a href="#97">FN97</a>] However,
the standards go on to recognize that the mediator may take on "an additional
dispute resolution role" at the request of the parties. [<a href="#98">FN98</a>]
While the standards suggest the assumption of such an additional role may
create "increased responsibilities and obligations that may be governed
by the standards of other professions" they give no hint just what those
ethics might be. [<a href="#99">FN99</a>]
<p>The Joint Committee's Standards is the recognition that mediators can
and do wear more than one dispute resolution hat is important. In this
respect the drafters of the code probably contemplated Med-Arb, the process
whereby disputants participate in mediation which, if unsuccessful, results
in arbitration, possible with the mediator serving as arbitrator. [<a href="#100">FN100</a>]
However, this provision of the code should also apply to the mediator who,
at the request of the parties, may undertake the additional dispute resolution
role of a lawyer.
<p>Thus, upon integrating lawyerly skills, the attorney-mediator "assumes
increased responsibilities and obligations that [are] governed by the standard
of [the legal] profession." [<a href="#101">FN101</a>] Unfortunately, since
the legal profession has yet to articulate and institutionalize a clear
national standard for attorney-mediators, we end up just where we started
- with no direct rules. Ironically, if the attorney-mediator were to look
to Model Rule 2.2 for such guidance, he would be refered back to some other
code, [<a href="#102">FN102</a>] which, would be the Joint Committee's
Standards if they are adopted as new uniform ethics - and back and forth
he would go, like the proverbial "hot potato."
<p>Richard E. Crouch has proposed a very good method of permitting the
introduction of legal advice by the attorney-mediator while assuring proper
protections of the disputants rights and expectations. [<a href="#103">FN103</a>]
Professor Crouch has proposed a code of ethics based on extensive pre-mediation
discussion and contractual agreement among the disputants as to the mediation
process. [<a href="#104">FN104</a>] The Crouch code, in pertinent part,
states:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>2. The undertaking of mediation itself should be set forth
in a written contract which both parties sign before entering into mediation.
All the warnings, waivers, and informed consents contemplated by this unique
form of [dispute resolution] should be embodied in the contract, but that
does not relieve the attorney who participates in mediation from his or
her obligation to explain the understandings effectively. The attorney
should be honestly satisfied that the parties fully understand and genuinely
consent to the conditions of mediation as required below. After signing,
nothing happens for three days.
<p>3. The parties should be warned that their interests are presumed to
be conflict on most points, and that they are waiving any objections to
the conflict of interest a lawyer necessarily has when serving in any way
the opposing parties in a conflict. It should be explained that this compromise
of loyalties is being allowed only because they consent to it . . . [<a href="#105">FN105</a>]</blockquote>

<p><br>Situations involving substantive unfairness and power imbalance
may be inappropriate disputes for resolution in mediation. [<a href="#106">FN106</a>]
Nevertheless, the bar should not require lawyers to paternalistically interfere
with every act that appears unfair, particularly where the disputants have
based a pre-mediation contract on substantive non-interference by the mediator.
However, certain procedures and outcomes are so unfair as to require the
organized bar to refuse participation to maintain integrity. I would suggest
the organized bar require attorney-mediators to prohibit processes and
agreements which would constitute defense to contract formation, with the
exception of lack of consideration. Such prohibition would include: mistake,
misrepresentation, fraud, illegality incapacity, lack of consent, duress
and coercion.
<p>Procedures and substantive agreements which are unfair or imbalancing,
but to which the parties have agreed to in principle after informed consent
should not be per se prohibited by a bar ethics rule. Of course, an outcome
can not be consented to with specificity at the outset of a mediation,
but the role of the mediators comments or advice regarding the agreement
can be determined in advance. However, as with my confidentiality suggestion,
each attorney would remain free to set higher standards of fairness for
mediation prior to assenting to become a mediator. Parties should be made
aware, however, that such a higher standards (such as the need to offer
unsolicited remarks about the fairness of an agreement) reflect the mediator's
personal standards, and are not the policy of the bar and that a bar association
list of attorney-mediator is available.
<p>It is axiomatic that, lacking incapacity, people can and should be relied
on to make their own decisions. Our form of government is based on the
concept of self-governance. [<a href="#107">FN107</a>] The Tenth Amenedment
to the U.S. Constitution explicitly recognizes that all power lies with
the people, except those enumerated functions [delegated to the federal
government or reserved to the states]. [<a href="#108">FN108</a>] Thus,
it should follow that the choice of the people as to how to adjust their
rights and responsibilities privately between themselves need not and must
not be unduly interfered with. Since certain disputes are complex, people
may want or need an attorney-mediator to assist them. People may even decide
to delegate a certain amount of their automony to their chosen attorney-mediator
so as to more efficiently adjust their affairs. None of this should be
objectionable to a free people. Absent some severe inequity, no bar association
should stand in the way of people who invite a member of that bar to assist
them in this way. However, where the legal rights of people must be respected,
it is prudent for the bar to require the attorney to fully consult with
the disputants as to the implications of such representation and to require
the clarity and effect of a contract with respect to their choice.
<p>I suggest that the American Bar Association adopt two new Model Rules
governing attorney-mediators. First, the final version of the Joint Committee's
Standards should be adopted - assuming all three participating organizations
can ultimately agree on a uniform document. [<a href="#109">FN109</a>]
This will serve as a basis for uniform expectation for the bar, mediators
and disputants. Further, attorneys will not be put by the bar at a market
disadvantage due to the imposition of a higher set ethics than other practitioners
in the mediation market. Second, the American Bar Association should adopt
a rule recognizing that attorneys may practice what is now known as intermediation
while mediating. As asserted above, whether the attorney conducts a mediation
subject to the non-intercessory style Joint Committee's Standards or, on
the other hand, one which permits use of legal skills on behalf of the
disputants would depend on the terms of the pre-mediation contract negotiated
by the parties. In this way, attorneys can provide a truly full service
- including certain mediation services which would be prohibited by lay-mediators
as unauthorized practice of law.
<p>Finally, in addition to the prohabition against participating in procedures
or outcomes which would prevent contract formation (fraud, mistake etc.)
the bar should also create an aspirational duty to refuse or withdraw from
mediations with lesser, but still serious, forms of power imbalace, intimidation,
coercion and intractable conflicts between the parties. [<a href="#110">FN110</a>]
<p><a NAME="VI Conclusion"></a><b>VI Conclusion</b>
<p>Disputants can benefit significantly in the course of mediation from
an attorney-mediator who applies legal skills on their behalf. Relevant
attorney-mediator skills include legal advice, evaluation, drafting and
potentially representation of the agreement in court. Such mediation can
cost less, move quickly and result in better agreements than other forms
of dispute resolution - especially litigation. Where the use of professional
legal skills creates a lawyer-client relationship, additional ethical standards
should apply when an attorney-mediator assumes such a role.
<p>The American Bar Association, as the nations premier legal organization,
should take affirmative steps to promote attorney-mediation by encouraging
accredited law schools to teach mediation. [<a href="#111">FN111</a>] and
by promulgating appropriate amendments to the Model Rules. The amended
Rules should recognize the existence dual styles of ethics governing attorney-mediators
- a non-intercessory neutral code (to be based on the Joint Committee's
Standards and adopted by the House of Delegates) and a professional attorney-mediator
code (to be based on the existing Rule 2.2). The amended Rule 2.2 should
include specific provisions dealing with the situation of the attorney-mediator,
should explicitly allow the attorney-mediator to represent all parties,
should premise itself on party self-determination as assured through pre-mediation
contractual agreement, should include minimum safeguards for procedural
and substantive fairness and should encourage attorney-mediators to participate
in a bar association lawyers list of pro-bono independent counsel for mediation
disputants in need thereof.

the lawyer-client relationship. Fisk was quoted as saying: "a lawyer is
a mandated secret-keeper, and a mediator is not a mandated reporter of
abuse in Massachusetts at this time. But we [Fisk and his partner] advocate
that a mediator should disclose because we think we should elevate the
mediation profession . . . [clients] have not hired me as a lawyer, they
have hired me as a mediator." Barbara Rabinovitz, Reconcilable Differences:
