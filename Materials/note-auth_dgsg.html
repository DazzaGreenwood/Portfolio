<p>Chas (and the members of the list)

</p><p>I frankly don't have a strong opinion about what definitions end up
being generally used in law and practice - but I certainly agree that the
concepts of technical authentication and legal signatures need to be kept
separate (though they become related in real deployments). For this post,
I will use the definition of authenticate that you put forward and the
definition of signature used in the November Uniform Electronic Authentication
Act ("Signature means any symbol, sound, process or encryption of a record
in whole or in part, executed or adopted by a person or the person's electronic
agent with intent to (i) identify the party; (ii) adopt or accept a term
or a record; or (iii) establish the information integrity of a record or
term that contains the signature or to which a record containing the signature
refers.").

</p><p>You said:

</p><p>&gt;I think it is useful in drafting rules and talking about the subject,
to keep the concept of intent consciously separate from the
<br>&gt;more *objective* concept of "authentication". To me, "authenticate"
without expressing an object means to "authenticate
<br>&gt;identity". I also think that with an express object provided, the
word tends to fit well with "authenticate identity of the
<br>&gt;signer," or "authenticate integrity of a message or record".

</p><p>Given the fact that this list relates to digital signature law, I would
like to further explore your point about making rules. While I have participated
in the construction of technical systems that require the objective capacity
to authenticate identity of a network user or device, I have frankly not
seen any advantage in drafting rules (either statutory, regulatory or contractually
based) that presume to bind or hold a party to the contents of a message
without direct reference to the second definition of signature from the
ETA draft. Here is what I am getting at: what is the definition of the
term "digital signature?" If it merely comprehends authentication, then
no rule based scheme that would create a binding presumption or attribution
of intent on the purported signer to be bound by particular terms or records
would seem logical or fair. If, on the other hand, the term includes the
concept of agreement to be bound or to accept a term or record, then:

</p><p>1. would the mere presence of authentication technology in any way assure
the intent needed for a signature (using the second ETA definition), and

</p><p>2. would not the presence of UDAC type contextual cues, direct notice
of implications and gravity prompts be a welcome and important functional
addition to the use of PKI-based digital "signature" systems for the creation
of legally enforceable signatures?

</p><p>The definition of a digital signature in the Utah Act, for example,
reads:

</p><p>"a transformation of a message using an asymmetric cryptosystem such
that a person having the initial message and the signer's public key can
accurately determine whether:

</p><p>(a) the transformation was created using the private key that corresponds
to the signer's public key; and

</p><p>(b) the message has been altered since the transformation was made."

</p><p>This seems to be a very good example of the narrow concept of authentication
that you mention in your post. Looks a bit weak in the signature (definition
two) department though . . . Are we sure we want to bind people to that
alone? Or, is it necessary to look to other interface and/or extrinsic
contextual factors in order to assure the *subjective* element of intent
is present? Relegating the term intent to the category of "subjectivity"
should not mean ignoring the fact that it is legally required, commercially
important, and socially valued for many of the online interactions digital
signatures claim to enable.

</p><p>A good point regarding the GSA procurement was made on this list, distinguishing
between authentication for access control and authentication meant to form
part of a binding signature. In my experience, using authentication for
access control is usually bounded merely by a requirement for the first
and sometimes the third) signature definitions of the ETA draft. The intent
portion the under girds the authentication for access control occurs on
the part of the controller at the time when a decision is made to permit
a given user or device entry access (often premised upon organizational
role, authorization, or legal right to data). But again, this does not
let digital signatures off the hook. Use of PKI for access control in implementations
like SSL3 do not really use a digital signature. Rather, it merely checks
a certificate against a pre-approved list of access enabled entities and
allows or rejects access thereupon. S/MIME comes a lot closer.

</p><p>My questions for Chas, and the list as a whole, are this:

</p><p>what technical protocols and other application or practical elements
need to be present to assure intent for purposes of creating a valid, binding
enforceable electronic signature? There are, for example, some notice screens
that are tripped by use of S/MIME in Netscape. Is that really enough? How
do we need to do better in order to create implementations that rise to
the real business challenge of signatures in cyberspace? What is the relevance
of the proposed UDAC in this regard? Does it respond to the need well or
is it missing something? In short: What is missing, how can it be deployed
and how well does it scale to an infrastructure solution?
