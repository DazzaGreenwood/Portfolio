<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>For leaders in the public

technology to authenticate citizens and business will be among the most
important of all matters to shape the coming information age.<span

government leadership in the information age, the key ideas are as old – or
older – than the country itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So it is
with the recently invigorated debate over identity management.<span

protecting citizen freedoms, privacy and other prerogatives on one end of the

on the other end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Indeed, the
philosophical and political implications of choosing various proposed solutions
cut to the core of the relationship between government and citizen – is
creation and use of a person’s identity flatly subject to central decree or
must it be based upon consent of the governed?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The current system of identity in the United States is, at best, a
patchwork of different – sometimes inconsistent – processes, practices and
rules of law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Whether or not it is desirable, is it

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h1>The Starting Point: Common Practice and Common Law</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>The advent of the networked
age and ubiquitous computing is pressuring many areas of society to become more
explicit about the existence, scope, meaning and usage of the otherwise largely
implied depths of personal identity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>The status quo is that
people are entitled to conceal their identity by being anonymous or to use
other identities by using pseudonyms provided they do so with no intent to
commit crime or other frauds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Here is
an everyday example: When walking into a store in the physical world, a person
has always had the discretion to identify herself if asked, or to decline to
identify herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In fact, there is
generally no rule against giving a pseudonym to a store clerk or anybody else
when you wish to keep your real identity private.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>This can be done, for
example, to prevent people from knowing your home identity and risking
unwarranted and unwelcome later contact from that person.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Unwelcome later contacts could include
unsolicited marketing or even undesired contacts by people seeking friendship
or romance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At the extreme end of the
scale, some unfortunate people require help from their places of work and government
agencies to conceal their whereabouts and other personally identifiable
information from disgruntled former employees or ex-spouses, stalkers or others
who would do them harm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A milder
example of lawful concealing of identity is the movie star who goes in public
wearing a wig, using an alias, and trying to “keep a low profile”.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For a deep treatment of the laws and rules
protecting the basic American right to remain anonymous or use pseudonyms, see
Anonymity and Encryption in Internet Commerce (<a
href="http://www.civics.com/content/cryptonon">http://www.civics.com/content/cryptonon</a>)
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Here is the bottom-line: It
is today the right of a citizen, absent a specific law to the contrary (as when
exercising the right to buy a gun or when seeking a Passport) to use any name
they desire at any time, without government approval, unless they do so with
the intent to defraud.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This has been
the basic “common law” rule for hundreds of years (if not more).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For that matter, a person is still at
liberty to indicate that they are simply browsing or “window shopping” when
approached by sales staff and need not even provide a pseudonym if they so
choose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There is generally no law
against saying “thanks, but I’m all set for now” when asked if you can be helped,
or if someone insists on wringing a name out of you, you are at liberty to use
an alias.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Some exceptions to this
basic rule, beyond fraud, include certain states which allow the use of aliases
but require that additional names used for business be registered typically at
a town or city hall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Another example of
a spin on this rule occurs in states that require citizens to go to court to
request a formal change of name.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>States
without such requirements simply extend the common law rule whereby anyone can
change their name at will or use various names for various activities.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>States with statutes requiring a formal
proceeding in order to effect a legal name change will also usually allow
people to use other names even without specific approval.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For example, in a 1969 New York court case,
a judge ruled that while the petitioner was not granted a legal name change due
to a technical rule, he was still at liberty to use his desired name in all the
ways he had always done so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In that
case, the person had been known by the single Sanskrit name Arindam for years
by friends, family and business associates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In fact, he had registered for his Social Security and automobile club
memberships under his chosen new name.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This case demonstrates how of what little consequence a “legal” name
change can be in states that require it as a formality.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In a different court in New Jersey in 1996,
it was ruled that a petitioner could effect a legal name change to a single
name despite the record-keeping inconvenience to government agencies.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In effect, the liberty of that person to
enjoy a name change was paramount since, according to American Jurisprudence,
the “state’s computer programmer’s and record keepers were capable of adjusting
their systems to accommodate unusual names.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Even in states that require
formal name change or “doing business as” registrations for aliases, the
Supreme Court has held the general national rule is that any person may
communicate political speech anonymously or with an assumed name.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This freedom derives from the First
Amendment and is necessary to prevent the chilling effects of having to
identify oneself with potentially unpopular political views, possible
retribution from employers or other personal attack.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Whether a given state requires a formal proceeding to change
“legal” name or not, people remain at liberty in general to use any identity
they wish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When this liberty is coupled
with the common practice of using cash to effect transactions in physical
environments, it is easy to see how creating stricter management of identity
poses challenges for policy makers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h1>e-Tailing and the Drive for “Usernames”</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>When the same type of retail
transaction mentioned above (person “window shopping” at store) is accomplished
electronically, it is quite likely that the individual will be required to
complete a new user registration process, agree to lengthy terms and condition,
in the process, and use a form of payment (typically credit card) that provides
a high degree of certainty as to the user’s identity.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Leaving aside the related policy issues of undesired direct
marketing and the process of consenting to have one’s personal information
shared among business affiliates, it is simply important to note that the
business transaction environment for personal identity is potentially dramatically
different when conducted online versus offline.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The reasons for these differences, in the retail environment at
least, are fairly clear: immediate transactions require immediate electronic
payment options; the opportunities for fraud and misuse of automated systems
are potentially different in terms of scale and velocity (e.g.: hackers can
potentially conduct many fraudulent transactions in a short time) and a
perceived business value is assigned to so-called “Customer Relationship
Management”, whereby a business web site operator can track the activities and
communications with a customer over time to provide higher levels of service
and better manage market expectations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>But these modern methods of identifying and continually authenticating
customers throughout an online relationship have consequences far beyond the
initial business drivers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>The same types of
transitions are occurring (albeit more slowly) in the public sector.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>State government portals are increasingly
offering or requiring a “user id” for citizens or businesses to access parts of
the public sector web presence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
specific drivers in the public sector are better understood with reference to
the diagram below illustrating the 5 stages web enabled evolution in the public
sector.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The usual first step in
adopting a web presence for a government agency is to public a “static” web
site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That means a site that simply
displays straight text about such things as the agency mission, hours of operation
and address and other helpful information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This is like a brochure or infomercial, in that it is “one size fits
all” and “one to many” “broadcast style”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The next stage of evolution in adoption of web technologies will often
involve the incorporation of interactivity into the web site.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For example, a user might be able to input
her zip code to get a dynamically generated screen showing all the widget
registries in her area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This technology
involves use of a data base and some way to generate new screens of information
on the user’s web browser according to the information queried or input by the
user.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>The next stage of
development is to turn some of those interactions into transactions.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In other words, allowing users to conduct a
formal or business type of transaction via the web with the agency.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Tax filings, license renewals and grant
applications area examples of these types of transactions.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In this context, the term transaction does
not necessarily have to involve the transfer of money – though it typically
does.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Filling out an official form or
making official statements should be considered a transaction because such
conduct changes the rights and responsibilities of the parties in important
ways and can lead to serious consequences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>After enabling a number of transactions, one or more agencies will feel
pressure to begin to make it easy for the user and for the back-office
personnel and systems to start to integrate some of the related
transactions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For example, it is common
for a business to have to file forms with many state (and other) government
departments when hiring a new employee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Rather than making the business start fresh on each agency web site, and
fill out much of the same information multiple times, integrating the process
into a single interface and transaction is more convenient, faster, and less
expensive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Theoretically, once enough
transactions and interactions have been integrated from the point of view of
the citizen or business, then in a very real sense, the government as an entity
is transformed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is certainly true
in the eyes of the persons dealing with government.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>But it will also be true in that these sorts of front-end integrations
will force back-end government changes like interoperability of systems, work
flows, mergers and other reorganizations that would otherwise not occur.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The dream is that this will constitute a
transformation of government from a rigid, bureaucratic, inward-looking
industrial style organization to a more agile, responsive, accountable and
transparent citizen-centered organization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>There are any number of
technologies that can accomplish the type of identity management and
authentication mentioned above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Technologies are not neutral.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Theoretically, at least, the
combination of technologies, legal arrangements, practices and business models
that are required to enable so-called “Public Key Infrastructure” (PKI) are
supposed to result in a means to manage user identity across various computing
systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Unfortunately, PKI has failed
to catch on in the market due to the high cost, difficulty of implementation,
user-resistance and mismatched implied business models and practices that go
along with it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For more information on
the difficulty related to PKI, as it had been proposed in initial form, please

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Of course, the use of
various public key based cryptographic technologies can be very effective as
part of an authentication and security system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>For example, the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is widely used to
encrypt web traffic between users and organizations and it is a very good
technical protocol.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Part of the reason
it works so well and is so widely adopted is precisely because it does not
require explicit recognition of the PKI preferred business model of a “trusted
third party” or any special user software configuration or – more to the point
– any user authentication at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>PKI,
by sharp contrast, assumes that each individual user is identified once for
every subsequent transaction facilitated by that person’s “digital
certificate”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This, in turn, assumes
that each person has become subject to a complex set of legal contracts or
other agreements and that an overarching set of intertwined global hierarchies
of business exist to identify, certify and consistently attest to the name of
the person and perhaps their role or authority as well.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Obviously, no such system is
widely in use today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>More importantly,
the very essence of the presumed business problem that PKI was designed to
address is a perceived need for one stranger to suddenly do trusted business
with another stranger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This so-called
“stranger to stranger” commerce was to be addressed by the “trusted third
party” who would, in essence, introduce and verify the identity of each
stranger to the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This process
stands in such stark contrast to the way business relationships are
accomplished today that it has primarily been met in the marketplace with a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>The vast majority of
businesses and governments that use electronic authentication today do so
without PKI.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is because the way
transactions are primarily done in the private and the public sectors are
through business processes that inherently address the question of whether or
not the parties should trust each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The intermediation of a new business party who exists solely to identify
and vouch for the identity of another party has no place in existing business
processes and does not directly respond to the questions one must ask in order
to strike up a trusted relationship with another party.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The many-fold issues that accompany business
relationship initialization include: market reputation, solvency of the other
party, quality of service or product, and so forth.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>The methods by which this
type of data is collected are all important inputs into the perceived risk and
value of accepting a newly identified business partner, supplier, buyer or
other affiliate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If the reputation is
based upon a testimonial from a trusted friend, that may be even more important
that a bond rating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Once the decision
to accept a newly identified party has been made, there is a second-order
mechanical problem of assuring that communications with that party have not
been impersonated or otherwise compromised.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Information security technologies, including public key cryptosystems,
are good tools to assure these lower-level types of information assurance.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These technologies are not, however, a good
substitute for the existing elements of due diligence and common sense that
underpin the creation of a business or other important relationship between
parties that were formally strangers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>The diagram below
illustrates the presumed role of a “trusted third party” technology provider of
digital certificates called a “certification authority”.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Notice that in the utopian world assumed by
this model, the user (say a customer of a merchant) and the business may have
no other basis of risk assessment or trust building other than the
intermediation of the technology provider.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This is called the “three cornered model of PKI”, because on one corner
there is the user who was issued a digital certificate, on the opposite corner
is the party conducting a transaction with the user and who identified the user
through her certificate, and on the top of all the market places that might
participate in this model exists the certification authority.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A slight variation of this three cornered
model is the four cornered model of PKI, in which the certificate repository
(the technology service whereby a person can check the validity of a digital
certificate) could be split off and performed by a different company in a peer
relationship with the certification authority.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>All of these increasing
levels of hardship, however, pale in comparison to what occurs when systems of
identity and business processes from internal operations come into contact with
those from external entities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Whether
those external entities be other states, other levels of government or private
sector organizations, they are all difficult.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Of course, when the other levels of government are localities that can
be directed to act by the state (as is the law in some jurisdictions), the
difficulty is greatly reduced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In fact,
it is a qualitatively different type of difficulty.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>This is because there is a hierarchical relationship that exists
and one party can demand action by the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>By contrast, when an organization like a state government seeks to
create an identity management system with an external organization that it can
not directly control, like another state, a private company, or even a cluster
of companies, then a strategic approach is needed.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The interests, preferred technologies and approaches of the other
parties become critical to accommodate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Similarly, the underlying rights and obligations flowing from identity
control will need to be apportioned among the stakeholders with the
responsibility to stand behind them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>That suggests that a federated system of some kind is needed rather than
a command and control system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Notice that the government
to external systems (g-2-external) involves two ovals that can be thought of as
equally large (or perhaps the external system is larger, in that it can not be
ordered around).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nonetheless, assuming
there is some specific business reason for the government and external systems
to interoperate, then it is possible to assign a value to the benefit of that
synergy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For example, if each
organization saves $100 million, then even a few million dollars in cost and
hassle in combining the systems may be worth it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>More typically, while technology makes many interoperations and
shared identity transactions possible, the business and legal demands that must
be answered make it infeasible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In
addition, it is necessary to create governance layers to manage such
inter-enterprise systems whereby the stakeholders all have a proportional say
in the structure and rules.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This means
it is best to only attempt planning identity management systems when there is a
clear business case for them, and to leave more global systems for future
phases of development when more is known.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Notice also that the creation of an Identity System by government that
would be used by purely external parties can be seen as much larger than state
government and immeasurably more complex and difficult to create.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Arguably, such systems should be the result
of many more decades of experience and practice rather than built now, in
advance of the business, governance and legal regimes necessary to support
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
