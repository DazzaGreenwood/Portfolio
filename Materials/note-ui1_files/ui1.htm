<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Based upon Ben Wright's recent postings on the proposed
<A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Ben_Wright/ceremony.htm">Uniform
Document Authentication Component</A> (UDAC), this list has begun an exploration
of the softer but no less important issues of context, cues and agreement
that surround usage of electronic authentication. Ironically, perhaps,
I think the best application of this type of ceremonial technical component
would be coupled closely with PKI based authentication mechanisms. For
those applications that require agreement to terms (any contract, license,
filing, application, registration, etc.) such a component would greatly
enhance the effectiveness of a raw digital signature. I posit that merely
including links to pages of disclaimers and volumes of notices is not sufficient.
Rather, we need a simple, comprehensible interface environment to support
the human element of electronic interactions. I believe that the legal
issues flow from the human behavior - not the other way around. (at the
end of this message is an excerpt from an article I wrote last November
on this topic)</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>There are a number of transactions where a solemnity requirement
is "built in" legally. Enfeoffment (passing the twig to signify the purchase
of land) was a great example. Some on this list have also cited things
like marriage agreements, wills and "Kevorkian agreements" (is there a
connection here? ; ) Lets take all those applications as clear cases of
the helpfulness of Ben's proposed ceremonial technical component. In addition
to all of those clear cases, I think there is a broad range of other non
solemn or less high value electronic interactions where such a component
would be really useful - perhaps even necessary.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>To my mind, one of the major difficulties remaining for
electronic commerce and online government is the absence of intuitively
comprehensible methods for knowing "where" we are, "what" we are doing
and "who" we are doing it with in cyberspace. The book "City of Bits" by
William Mitchell does an excellent job of detailing the rich combination
of environmental cues, clues and general context that surrounds most human
activity in physical space. When we are in a bank we know we are in a bank.
When we sign a contract, it is clear that something important is happening.
When we are in a government office getting information, or walking into
a pub to order a beer and so on, the behavioral expectations and predictability
of outcomes are quite well established. The current state of the art in
electronic interaction systems is crude indeed by comparison. I co-teach
a course Bill Mitchell that deals with some of these issues called "Designing
Electronic Commerce and Online Government." The URL is for this semester
is: http://architecture.mit.edu/class/4.195/ Interestingly, this course
deals with legal and policy issues - but it is situated within the School
of Architecture and Planning at MIT (however, so is the MIT Media Lab -
so the multidisciplinary effort is not unprecedented).</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Most behavior is self regulating and not forced by rule
of law or other external compulsion. People need context and experience
in an environment in order to interact effectively. The act of submitting
a form or agreeing to terms or communicating on a list are all small expressions
of a wider contextual set of transactional expectations and behavioral
norms. When dealing with people in an online environment, it can be helpful
to consider the "space" in which the interaction is taking place. By today's
usual computation methods, we are probably talking about a physical restriction
of a screen on a monitor. Beyond that, we quickly get into issues of User
Interface design. The psychological aspects of this type of design are
complex. It can be hard to know what people are thinking when they use
a given system. What do they think the buttons do? What do they think the
point of the system is supposed to be?</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>When we speak with people face to face, several misunderstanding
can occur, without the benefit of body language and other such cues, the
incidence of systems and users "talking past" each other spikes up. What
does the button "OK" mean? What might be the result of selecting one of
several items from a pull down menu and hitting something that says "submit"
(will it mean I submitted a request for information with no obligation
or that I submitted to the will of some powerful party that will now send
me bills or otherwise hassle me?).</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The discipline of architecture and planning has long dealt
with these types of issues. The design of physical space has a serious
component of psychology. The space is designed and built for the users
who will traffic it. The users who create network traffic into an online
system are seldom so lucky. We need more creative tools like the one Ben
Wright is proposing to help us build the types of electronic commerce and
other online environments that will be necessary to support the important
activity people would like to carry on in cyberspace.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>In my view, important activity is not restricted to such
items as wills and sales of land. The sum of fifty smaller transactions,
like subscriptions, orders of products and transmittals of government forms
are all important enough to warrant a closer examination of the interface
infrastructures that support them. I use the term "interface infrastructure"
because I hope it conveys the idea that disputes will not only be based
on the question "was it YOU who pressed this button" but will also (perhaps
more often) derive from the assertion "I remember being on your site, but
I never agreed to X!" The meaning of unfair and deceptive practices in
the physical world is still subject to significant dispute. How much worse
do we expect it will become via online channels unless our interface infrastructure
is based upon widely accepted and understood mechanisms representing agreement
to terms, personal identity, indication of "where" one is (e.g. what organization
runs this server? Is this Fleet Bank or Microsoft?) including an indication
of what jurisdiction one is operating (if I fly to Iran, and say or buy
or do something, then I have a good idea under what jurisdiction and norms
I am operating - how do I get that information in a reliable, simple to
understand method from my online environment?). I use the term infrastructure
because I believe that ubiquitous usage of online technologies in open
network environments will require widely accepted Interface norms - such
as a UDAC. The gravity prompts and other systemic functions built into
this component can provide a sound starting point for getting to the next
level of wide spread deployment of interactions online.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>==========</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The following is an except from the short article: "Federal
Case Indicates the Need for Information Age Reforms in Business, Policy
and Law " available at: <A HREF="http://www.tiac.net/biz/danielg/kaspar9.htm">http://www.tiac.net/biz/danielg/kaspar9.htm</A></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>As more transactions take place electronically, including
transaction that will require some solemnity, the question should be: how
shall we express enfeoffment electronically? Enfeoffment was the act of
going to the land and handing over a twig ceremonially in front of witnesses
to signify the purchase and sale of land. This act was done to solemnify
the transaction. The policy behind this solemnification was, in part, to
assure there was no mistake about the nature and gravity of the transaction.
How should such solemnity be achieved via communication technologies that
allow for remote parties to transact business?</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>When some people indicate that this is a security issue
I feel that is like saying: building a house is a hammer and nails issue.
In the first place, we have an architectural question: what design requirements
exist to create a structure that serves the purpose and won't fall down
when pushed? Then we use the available tools to construct it. In this case,
we construct an interface, application, network and records management
environment that is replete with appropriate practices and agreements).
What are the minimum requirements of this environment? There will almost
certainly be a need for security dimensions as well. However, here, the
mere "signature" and "writing" requirements are not met by secure systems
but by understandable systems.</FONT>
