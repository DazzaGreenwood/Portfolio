Reforms in Business, Policy and Law</font></b>

<hr width="100%">

<p><font size="-1">Judge Porfilio of the Tenth Circuit (No. 96-1462, 9/30/97
and available at www.tiac.net/biz/danielg) recently held that a computer
record did not constitute a "writing" under the Bankruptcy Code. The case,
In re Kaspar, deals with a lender that tried to avoid having its loan discharged
in bankruptcy by claiming that the debtors' statement of financial condition
was materially false. However, the Bankruptcy Code provides an exception
from discharge only if the materially false statement on which the lender
relied was in writing. In this case, the information was obtained from
the debtors over the telephone and entered into a computerized form by
the lenders' representative, who then read the information back to the
debtors to verify it had been entered correctly. The court held that this
did not constitute a writing, concluding with this invitation to Congress:</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">"We note with some wryness that in this instance the law
lags behind technology and custom, but that gap is a subject which must
be addressed to the Congress and not the courts. We will not undertake
to rewrite the express language of a statute merely to accommodate the
commercial conveniences attributable to modern technology."</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">The Kaspar case is important both for what it requests
and what it rejects. The judge makes a very good plea for Congressional
reform of writing and signing requirements that exist in federal statute.
However, the judge refuses to use the power of the judiciary in this case
to interpret these requirements to be consistent with modern practices
and electronic media. It is instructive that the judge noted, as a policy
basis of his holding, that exceptions to discharge under the bankruptcy
statute are interpreted narrowly.</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">In view of this type of admirable judicial restraint,
the current Massachusetts Electronic Records and Signature Act specifically
includes guidance to the judiciary in the following terms:</font>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><ul><b><font size="-1">Section 5. Writings and Signatures Generally.</font></b>
<br><font size="-1">". . . In general, where any rule of law purports to
specify a particular medium for the creation, storage, communication, or
authentication of any records or information, that requirement shall be
liberally construed to allow the broadest possible use of electronic or
digital methods unless there is clear public interest to the contrary."</font></ul>
<font size="-1">In the Kaspar case, had federal policy makers enacted a statute
like the proposed Massachusetts Act, then the judge who is so concerned
with following statutes to the letter would have been encouraged to interpret
the writing requirement more broadly. In cases where no particular public
interest compels narrow interpretation of a writing or signature requirement,
then this statutory provision should permit and even direct the judiciary
to allow a record consisting on any medium to meet the writing requirement.
The judge would have had more latitude to hold that the debt incurred based
on a false statement of financial condition would not be discharged - irrespective
of the media used to transmit, record or create the record.</font>

<p><font size="-1">As more transactions take place electronically, including
transaction that will require some</font> <font size="-1">solemnity, the
question should be: how shall we express enfeoffment electronically? Enfeoffment
was the act of going to the land and handing over a twig ceremonially in
front of witnesses to signify the purchase and sale of land. This act was
done to solemnify the transaction. The policy behind this somemnification
was, in part, to assure there was no mistake about the nature and gravity
of the transaction. How should such solemnity be achieved via communication
technologies that allow for remote parties to transact business?</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">When some people indicate that this is a security issue
I feel that is like saying: building a house is a hammer and nails issue.
In the first place, we have an architectural question: what design requirements
exist to create a structure that serves the purpose and won't fall down
when pushed? Then we use the available tools to construct it. In this case,
we construct an interface, application, network and records management
environment that is replete with appropriate practices and agreements).
What are the minimum requirements of this environment? There will almost
certainly be a need for security dimensions as well. However, here, the
mere "signature" and "writing" requirements are not met by secure systems
but by understandable systems. Why should synchronous phone interactions
by the parties buttressed by contemporaneous entries into a database be
inadequate?</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">I believe that the judge failed to adequately weigh the
fact that the electronic record in question was comprised of verified answers
to credit data supplied by the Kaspars themselves and entered into a computer
and database by a loan officer based on contemporaneous transcription.
According to the opinion: "the loan representative then read the figures
back to the Kaspars who orally verified their accuracy" and it was based
on this exchange that the electronic record was authenticated and relied
on by the lender. As usual in cases involving the validity of electronic
records and authentication, the issue litigated in this case did not involve
attempted repudiation or the integrity of the data. The Kaspars apparently
did not contest the integrity of the electronic record or that they had
in fact assented to the information for the purpose of creating a complete
loan application with terms and conditions binding each party.</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">The facts of the case require more detailed analysis.
What if the Kaspars had used a personal secretary to type their application
for them? Imagine that they simply dictated the information to their secretary
who faithfully and accurately input the data and who then signed and delivered
the application at the Kaspar's behest and on their behalf. Does this become
a stronger case if the secretary reads back the information to the Kaspar's
to verify the accuracy? I assume no writing formality issue would arise
under those facts and that the debt would not have been discharged. What
if a computer were used by the Kaspar's agent? Obviously, it no longer
matters as a matter of law that computers are used to generate records
that are printed on paper and then delivered. But what if the electronically
signed computer record were delivered to the loan officer in electronic
form - say on disk or by e-mail? Why should that make any difference to
the legal result?</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">The fact that the Kaspars never actually "saw . . . the
application form entered into the computer" made an impression on the judge.
This is especially interesting because today, if you ask a really good
cognitive psychologist, she will tell you that some people comprehend spoken
information far better than data presented to them on a form (I would expect
this applies double to most financial forms I have seen). Unlike simply
looking at a financial form on paper, the Kaspars enjoyed the rare cognitive
benefit of having their information carefully read back to them so that
they had the occasion to hear every bit of information submitted. Ears
- unlike eyes, can not so easily close or turn their attention to another
location. This information was not only tendered by the Kaspars only minutes
before in response to direct question, but it was, in effect, then deposited
by the loan officer directly back into the conscious minds of the applicants
for their informed assent. The Kaspars could not help but know what they
were assenting to and acknowledge the basis of the loan transaction they
were undertaking. Furthermore, the judge can not seriously expect that
seeing information is a prerequisite for creating a legally binding writing.
Blind people would be at a bit of a disadvantage and so would a lot of
dictators (in the amanuensis sense - not the Saddam Hussien sense).</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">I do not suggest that the holding was unsupportable -
only that it points out the need for deeper thinking about the suitability
of electronic records and authentication under the law. Nor do I fault
the judge for coming to this holding. Perhaps the judge desired to make
a point that law and policy makers need to reach consensus about exactly
what practices will constitute enforceable and valid records and authentication.
I could not agree more. Merely indicating by statute that all writings
and signatures may be electronic is not good enough for many situation
that require some clearer indication that a party understands and agrees.</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">The judge goes to great pains to point out that false
statements of financial condition, to qualify under this exception, must
be in written form due to the solemnity of the transaction. The court notes
that:</font>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><ul><font size="-1">"giving a statement of financial condition is a solemn
part of significant credit transactions; therefore, it is only natural
that solemnity be sanctified by a document which the debtor either prepares
or sees and adopts. In a world where important decisions relating to the
extensions of credit and service will be made upon the contents of a statement
relating to financial condition, too much mischief can be done by either
party to the transaction were it otherwise. Somewhere in the commercial
risk allocation picture, the writing must stand as a bulwark which tends
to protect both sides. A creditor who forsakes that protection, abandoning
caution and sound business practices in the name of convenience, may find
itself without protection."</font></ul>


<p><font size="-1">But, in a digital world, what is the meaning of the word
"prepares?" When should a voice recognition systems that meets sufficient
quality benchmarks be granted the status of a legitimate method of preparation?
When is such a system to be considered part of a "sound business practice?"
What is the meaning of "sees and adopts?" A return e-mail that confirms
an application and is assented to would presumably qualify. The typical
question asked at this point is "what evidence of adoption is necessary
to prevent subsequent denial?" Click to adopt? Type your name in the "I
__________ hereby adopt" space? Use your password? Must we use our cryptographic
digital computer-steroid signature? While this question can be important,
these cases are seldom about repudiation. Too much other business context
typically exists to prevent such a shallow claim. Rather, the issue is
one of setting clear technical and practical benchmarks so every party
to such a transactions knows and can be shown to have known that they have
acted to create a binding document. I do not believe that use of a particular
technology is enough to achieve this. No matter how good a given digital
signature system may be, for example, if the issue is not about repudiation
and message integrity, then the system is not relevant.</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">What is needed here, among other things, are simple and
widely understood methods to symbolize an agreement reached via an electronic
network. For example, imagine an interface where the contract (or application,
or weekly time sheets, etc.) appeared as an object. When you were ready
to "sign" the object, you simply moved it into the zone on your screen
(or into a special directory, or through a designated router, etc.) where
you push the documents that legally bind you. Perhaps a warning message
comes up asking if you in fact want to be bound? Perhaps the interface
or application would not permit assent for a given "solemn" agreement to
be complete until an oral voice annotation of assent were also associated
with the object in addition to simple clicking. Or, (with the help of design-aware
interface engineers) perhaps we settle on shapes that symbolize each stage
of drafting and acceptance up to final binding assent. The object representing
the first draft may look like a circle and the lines on opposite sides
get closer together until you agree to a flat line that represents final
agreement. A contract with one final provision to be hammered out could
look like a flat line with one bump (of course, the bump is linked directly
to the provision in question). Alternatively, sounds or even gestures could
suffice (this is more far out technically, but the technical implementation
is far less important than the policy goal).</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">The point is that we need widely accepted ways to represent
the thresholds of legality afforded records in electronic form - especially
records that are the subject of multi-user inputs and that have legal consequence.
By multi-user, I mean records that go back and forth among drafters or
negotiators or co-workers, etc. I don't really care what those symbols
are (though they need to accommodate people with various disabilities,
including sight, hearing or tactile impediments) but they should be widely
understood - just as a manual signature is today. The PenOp system (which
allows people to manually sign electronic data) fulfills many of these
policy goals. However more robust interface standards are needed to accommodate
all technologies that would create legally binding agreements because we
need systems that will create predictable outcomes. Assuming that more
than one technology is available to prove assent was manifested, the screen
or other interface metaphors should still remain as consistent as possible
for the sake of end-user simplicity and the creation of reasonable expectations.</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">The best way to assure a predictable outcome is not to
legislatively mandate "this is how you make an enforceable contract on
the Internet" - but rather we should create an systems that people would
want to use because they are efficient and desirable and that also meet
the policy requirements for signaling unmistakably when a deal is sealed.
In other words, the market should evolve the systems and practices. These
systems are sorely needed to make networks truly useful for business. One
may be electronically drafting a contract, submitting an application, or
even making a parliamentary motion before a Board of Directors that is
meeting in an online conference (synchronous or asynchronous). Every participant
in that Board meeting (or Town Meeting, or Hearing, etc.) should be able
to see what motion is "on the table" and see when an amendment has been
accepted and changed the motion, etc.</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">Little naked encrypted message digests of hash function
results bouncing around my computer - while technically potentially useful
- are just are not good enough. Nor are biometrics by themselves or any
other "security" system. In a sense, this can be seen as an electronic
records management issue. This is also certainly an interface issue. There
is a "security" component (to the extent one needs to link the records
and authentication to a source for example). At core, however, this is
a business standards issue. Just as there have emerged a multitude of business
practices that are now reflected in the Uniform Commercial Code, so to
must there develop general usages for electronic records and authentication.
People need "simple to comprehend" symbols and methods to know where they
stand - and the law should support rational and accepted practices that
arise to meet this need.</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">The Kaspar judge noted that the loan practices were common
in the industry. If the use of a phone for dictation and input into a database
with final assent based on a "read-back" were to be the norm, and if that
were widely accepted, then the law should support these practices. However,
I suspect these particular practices, (while perhaps common in this particular
financial market slice, for that purpose and at that time) will not be
the widely used in electronic commerce because they are not "machinable".
That is, the Kaspar scenario required a live human on the bank side who
actually took down the information and read it back for approval. Frankly,
I would be shocked if electronic commerce systems reached this level of
effectiveness in the foreseeable future. Clearly, there will come a day
when loan applications will be done entirely over networks (probably with
the creditor's systems and not people). What systems and practices should
the law recognize as valid for such purposes?</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">Some might argue that the main issue in the Kaspar case
is that "the DEBTOR and not the lender must</font> <font size="-1">make the
statement in writing?" The statute provides, in relevant part, that a debt
shall not be discharged to the extent it was "obtained by use of a statement
in writing that is materially false . . . that the</font> <font size="-1">debtor
caused to be made or published with intent to deceive...." The statement
undeniably originated from, is attributable to and was verified by the
Kaspars. They "caused" the statement to be reduced to</font> <font size="-1">writing.
In what sense did they fail to make the statement? Do their fingers need
to be on the keyboard? Why?</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">The Graham case (cited in Kaspar) held that: "defendants
caused a written statement regarding their financial condition to be published
by providing plaintiff's telephone solicitor the financial information</font>
<font size="-1">contained on the written application for a credit card. A
written statement does not have to be physically prepared by a defendant.
The requirements of 523(a)(2)(B) are met if the existence of a written
statement was caused to be prepared by the defendant."</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">It sure looks to me like the existence of a written (electronic)
statement was caused to be prepared by the Kaspars. It might also be argued
that the Kaspar's never signed or authenticated the form. But why is voice
authentication and assent inadequate? In any case, there is no direct "signing"
requirement in the statute - just a writing requirement. The Kaspars are
not attempting to repudiate the fact that they orally made these statements.
Authentication and signing are, in a sense, moot points here.</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">I would assert that the case created an anomalous result.
That is, the law was interpreted in a way to allow a couple of people to
get out of paying debt that they incurred which would not have been discharged
had it not been for a shallow technicality. Perhaps this was the correct
legal interpretation - but the result is nevertheless puzzling. If the
statement came from their computer and was printed and mailed then this
would be a non-issue - I assume the debt would not have been discharged.
Similarly, if they dictated it to their computer (using voice recognition
software) without looking, it would still be a non-issue. If the computer
were in another room in their house, perhaps using a voice recognition
system connected by a local area network, then this would still be a non-issue
I would wager. In each case, the record was originated by and caused to
be made by the defendant. Is the rule that one may not opt against visually
reviewing applications in favor of the same online audio media available
to the blind? May only blind people create, review and approve valid electronic
records in this manner? If this is the proposed rule, then how bad must
one's eyesight become before she may avail herself of this potentially
superior method of managing records and conducting business?</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">If the key issue is not that the application must be personally
typed and visually reviewed, then why should it matter where the record
is created? If the computer were in the home of a friendly neighbor of
the defendant, connected by a wide area network, activated by a voice recognition
system in the Kaspar's house, and then printed and mailed, would the result
change? What if a party finds it convenient or cost-effective to house
voice originated record creation systems in a data center shared by several
businesses? The parties use their phones from the efficient comfort of
their office or home and get voice and/or text verification. Would only
text verification be acceptable? What if a verification service were outsourced?
In these cases, from the point of view of the lender, a paper record would
be received which the defendant caused to be made. When the record is entered
in a computer in the lender's office connected by a network ("voice protocol")
to the defendant who originated the record and caused it to be made, why
does the result change?</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">Why would this be different from the Kaspar case? The
Kaspar's apparently did not argue that the lender had altered the record
or that the record was inaccurate. Where is the line to be drawn? What
systems, applications, network environments and practices shall create
valid applications?</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">Whatever the law accepts, it is in the interests of general
electronic commerce that the practices and systems be as consistent as
possible across private economic sectors and the public sector. It would
lead to confusion for too many different, perhaps contradictory, systems
and practices to emerge. The simple example would be that banking agreements
are final when you move the document to the right and leases are final
when you move them to the left - hence creating defenses where none should
exist. More realistically, sending an S/MIME message may mean "draft" in
one circumstance and "final agreement" in another context. Some way must
evolve for people to simply tell when they are doing something that is
final and/or binding. In short, we need to evolve standards - not in the
narrow technical sense (ANSI, NIST, etc.) but in the sense of widely accepted
combinations of technology, business practice and legal treatment. Though
the law should follow practice in this area because the market is so dynamic
and young (it can be said to be in a state of mitosis) I think a good start
would be abolishing explicit legal requirements for paper and ink.</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">The Kaspar case is another text book example of a fundamental
"turn of the century" need for statutory and regulatory legal reform of
medium specific requirements. These reforms need to occur within each jurisdiction
in which the medium specific laws creating barriers to commerce currently
exist. That means states need to reform our areas of existing jurisdiction
and the federal government must clean its own house. I believe it would
be unwise and unwelcome for our federal partners to view the need for such
law reform as an opportunity to change the underlying balance of substantive
jurisdictions between states and the federal government.</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">Just identifying these laws is quite difficult, but drafting
the best language to selectively repeal or amend them to be consistent
with appropriate methods will take even more work. There are some 4,515
such requirements in the Massachusetts General Laws alone! It will take
some time to reform each law and regulation - probably several years. In
the meantime, an early Act at the federal and state levels respectively
that reforms the easy to handle laws in a clean sweep and statutorily instructs
the judiciary and any other adjudicative body to interpret remaining requirements
to be consistent with information age practices would be an excellent first
step.</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">My sense is that such a "base-line" legal reform would
be appropriate to take place in the near-term - even before report of the
Uniform Electronic Transactions Act by the National Conference of Commissioners
on Uniform State Law (NCCUSL) which will deal with far more complex issues.
This Act is due out in a couple of more years or so. Meanwhile, states
are already converging on an "electronic signature" consensus - the vast
majority of legislation enacted at the state level merely creates "equivalence"
between paper and electronic media for writings and signatures. The recent
excellent Internet Law and Policy Forum legislative survey confirms this
trend.</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">I remain unconvinced that there is a need for federal
preemptive law in this area. However, to the extent federal law in this
area may end up preempting state law, Congress should attempt some creative
solutions to the issue; such as drafting a broad federal "electronic signature
and records" law with a provision that states shall enact "similar" or
"consistent" uniform law within x time. Tthis would not be unprecedented
- look, for example, to the Money Laundering federal law that explicitly
pointed to NCCUSL to write uniform law on non-depository institutions to
fill out the federal law or look to the real-life political formula between
the states and the federal government that led to Article 4A.</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">Another more aggressive and probably more problematic
approach would be for the federal law to apply equally to federal and state
law (effectively just eliminating state writing and signature requirements
that fall within the scope of the law) but then providing that the law
shall not take effect until the year X and that states may enact law that
further defines, expands or, if necessary for an important public interest,
limits the federal law - provided that the state laws are sufficiently
uniform and consistent with the federal law and that any statute that is
meant to modify the federal law explicitly so state within the body of
the statute (so everyone can see exactly what law applies in this regard).
That would allow states to either go along with the federal treatment of
the issue - assuming it was adequate - or to arrive at a superior treatment
that takes account of the several unique issues that arise under state
jurisdictions.</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">Under the latter approach, if states were to do nothing
- then the federal law would govern. Similarly, if states were to enact
inconsistent law - then the federal law would preempt by its own terms.
Under either approach, if the states were to act in some unforeseeable
manner that had the effect of disturbing interstate commerce, then the
federal government would always retain power under the commerce clause
to enact preemptive law once and for all. However, it seems to me that
we are in a period of transition and that law or policy makers at all levels
of government would do well to cut each other some slack and a bit more
time to come up with creative, well thought out and tailored solutions
to accomplish the legal reforms that are needed. Under either possible
preemptive solution explored above, and just in general, state and the
federal government must talk to each other about what we are doing in this
fast moving area to assure adequate coordination - including coordinating
approaches where we agree not to act - that is, to keep our grasping hands
off from the marketplace (that is my favored government action).</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">I am dubious about the merits of federal activism in the
area of electronic authentication that preempts state law or intrudes on
the market. Clearly all levels of government need to reform existing law
so as to remove barriers to commercial and other societal uses of information
technology. Beyond that, federal law should leave states and the market
alone to the maximal extent practicable. The core constitutional scheme
blessing the American people with a system of state and national government
comprising separate powers and jurisdictions has been an extremely helpful
innovation in the course of western civilization. It is working out quite
well for the country so far and we should tamper with it only based on
a showing of great need and a period of long deliberation. The balance
or separation of power works and has saved us from the occasional but cyclically
recurring bizarre mania associated with federal policy makers from generation
to generation (e.g. McCarthy) and has also prevented the worst excesses
at a state level from persisting against the conscience of the country
(e.g. racist state laws).</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">Issues central to electronic authentication and records
include contracts, commercial law, rules of evidence in state courts, state
chartered financial institution regulation, and many other areas of primary
(or exclusive) state jurisdiction. Several other bodies of law, such as
consumer protection, privacy and an array of records retention rules comprise
areas of state jurisdiction that are concurrent with that of the federal
government. Here to, further incursions into the areas of states interests
should be undertaken with care, discretion and mature restraint. The sovereignty
of our American states has been slowly diminished over the decades to feed
an increases in federal expansion. The prospect of yet another fundamental
shift in jurisdictions from the states to the federal government - this
time in the realm of electronic authentication and records - would leave
precious little to the states as our civilization crosses the brink to
ubiquitous use of information technology systems.</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">If the Kaspar case shows anything, it is that many complicated
areas of law exist that will require time to reform for the information
age. The stampede which has grown in strength over the past year for "over-arching
federal law" in the "short term" may be headed toward a cliff. Proponents
of such law often seek liability limits, government regulation or oversight,
aggressive preemption of state law and substantial reversal of evidentiary
presumptions. Such radical interference with the market and the careful
balance between levels of government, though probably constitutional, would
definitely be premature and prone to severe unintended consequences. Federal
government review boards with punitive regulatory powers or other similar
industrial-planning attempts would stymie a market that needs time to grow.
The market distortion following such a move would chill innovation and
lead toward a culture of "compliance" with the federal standards (rather
than more appropriate market-based standards). Merely having private sector
members of government regulation schemes does not create a market environment.
No market has ever been regulated into existence - and no government will
succeed in such an effort. Healthy, worthy markets arise as a result of
the interplay of supply and demand.</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">The Kaspar court noted only that " in this instance the
law lags behind technology and custom." The judge was wise in this respect
indeed. He did not indicate that "new law is needed to create predictable
legal outcomes" or that "we need new law to set the framework for electronic
commerce." Evidently, the judge would be quite capable of applying existing
law and reaching equitable and predictable results under this - or any
other - substantive area of law. The judiciary is being held back not by
the lack of new law for an information age - but by the existence of old
law from the industrial and agrarian ages that specifies media that no
longer make any sense. The emergence of business practices and technological
deployments to meet the demands of the market will evolve without special
laws or government actions to "spark" the market. Simply removing the impediments
will allow the flame to grow, but enacting new laws that reach into the
market or upset the American separation of powers may result in dousing
the fire and creating other problems as well. States and the federal government
would do well to take the court's advice at face value by focusing our
attention on matching the law to technology and custom - and no more. As
sound business practices and technologies come into wide spread use, the
law should take care to validate, enforce and otherwise support commercially
reasonable expectations.</font><font size="-1"></font>

</p><p><font size="-1">The judge, by requesting reform of federal law to remove
barriers and simultaneously refusing to step ahead of truly wide spread
practices or statutory rules of construction has articulated a direction
for legislatures and markets alike. This may be one of the ultimate expressions
of our judicial system's role - deciding a given case on its merits with
a mature, restrained communication of wisdom. Will we accept it?</font>
