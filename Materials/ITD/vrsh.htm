<h1>Toward a Virtual State House </h1>
</center>
The Information Technology Division is exporing the possibility of
using online virtual reality technology to enhance the service quality
and ease of use for citizens and businesses who use the state's web
site to get information from the state and conduct transactions with
the government. The purpose of this inquiry is to explore ways to use
powerful new VR technology over the Internet as a means of better
organizing and viewing public information and interacting with other
citizens and the government. A VR State House can leverage the large
amount of valuable public information now available on the official
Massachusetts web site in html format. In addition to merely providing
a static VR "front end" to the state's web site, a VR State House can
provide an intuitive interface for citizens to interact with the
information and with each other. <p>
Several private or corporate VR sites are popping up around the
Internet. The philosophy behind the VR State House inquiry is that the
emerging virtual world should include truly "public" space. That is,
space with civic significance where people can exercise their rights
and duties as citizens. What if you could participate in a public
hearing being conducted in Boston in one of the legislative hearing
rooms without going to Boston - or even leaving your house? The
un-intuitive "Internet chat" can be replaced by three dimensional
hearing rooms and representations of the people "present" - right on
your computer screen. Multi-user networked virtual spaces make possible
communications that could not happen in real space. The ability to
share large volumes of information and to collaboratively draft
documents and other materials is unprecedented. </p><p>
Unfortunately, today the chances are quite high that you have no idea
about public information, much less hearings, that directly effect you
and your family. The Internet can provide a more even distribution of
information to people from across the state about civic issues and
events that impact them. Individual citizens usually do not have the
resources to track legislation and other important issues, or to hire a
lobbying firm to do it for them. Citizens further away from Boston are
at an additional disadvantage based on simple geography. Virtual
Reality interface to public information can help make the most of the
potential of the Internet as an information equalizer. To the extent
that a VR model can show obvious connections between data models,
citizens looking at information for the first time can make more
sophisticated judgments that would otherwise require more study of rows
of numbers and columns of text. The ability to more intuitively display
information, and to make that information more malleable depending on
how the viewer wants to look at it is a strength of VR. When added to
the capacity to interact with the information, with other citizens and
with government officials, VR can become a potent civic tool.
</p><p>There are a number of ways to view government. It is possible
with a VR representation of information to chose the most logical or
efficient mental model, and base the virtual architecture on that
model. For instance, one way to think of government is as a lot of
legislation that starts in the House or the Senate and eventually is
presented to the Governor to become law and perhaps later appears
before the courts where further law is made. What if you could
literally see the movement of various legislative objects as they make
their way through the process? What if legislation pertaining to
subjects you were interested in was a different color, or shape so you
could easily observe it? Another way to think about the government is
as a lot of money that starts with the tax, fee and fine payer and
winds up in various public programs. What if you could literally see
how much of the government's proposed budget was proportioned to each
program? What if all legislation appeared as large or small as the
amount of money it would cost? What if you could see the whole budget
as a gold brick at the start of the year, and witness chunks taken out
of the brick as the money was spent - and what if you could really see
where it was going?
</p><p> Our intent is not to arrive at a very literal VR replication
of the brick and mortar State House, but rather to design the space in
a way that is more logical, intuitive and responsive to the citizens
who are seeking to move through the space to get information and
interact. The result will probably be a virtual space that resembles
the actual State House in few respects. One possibility is that the
constitution will be used as a blue print. In that case, the space
would be divided into the three branches of government (the judiciary,
the legislature and the executive). Another possibility is that the
space could reflect the line items spent in the budget (this much for
the courts, this much for welfare, that much for education and so on).
Or, perhaps the space can be programmed to reflect the information that
is important to the citizens who are in the space. For instance, a
program can be written that would bring parts of the virtual space
further into the foreground when those places are accessed more
frequently - thus the space would change to accommodate the needs of
people going to the space. The next team meeting - which will focus on
choosing a design, will prove to be one of the most important
cornerstones of the project.
</p><p>At this stage, we don't know exactly what design or
functionality a VR State House will finally have. It is entirely
possible that none of the above musings will be reflected in the final
outcome. What we are trying to do is solve a deeper problem than any
one particular technical application of VR or Hyper Text Transfer
Protocol functions. Our goal is to see whether there are better ways to
present data and to further the civic interest through the use of
virtual reality and other web based technology.
</p><hr>This project team is open to participation by private
citizens. Today, the team includes several people from MIT (including
the Media Lab and the School of Architecture and Design), Stanford Law
School Center for Technology Policy, Lockheed Martin Advanced
Distributed Simulation, the Liberty Cafe, Sense8 Corporation, and
several representatives from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
Information Technology Division.
