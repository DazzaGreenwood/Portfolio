<P><B>Section 1. Short Title. </B>This act shall be known as the "Massachusetts
Electronic Records and Signatures Act".

<P><B>Section 2. Purposes and Construction. </B>The provisions of this
act shall be construed:

<P>(a) to facilitate and promote electronic commerce and online government
by clarifying the legal status of electronic records and electronic signatures
in the context of writing and signing requirements imposed by law;

<P>(b) to permit and encourage the continued expansion of electronic commerce
and online government through the operation of free market forces rather
than proscriptive legislation;

<P>(c) to promote public confidence in the validity, integrity and reliability
of electronic commerce and online government; and

<P>(d) to promote the development of the legal and business infrastructure
necessary to support and encourage electronic commerce and online government.

<P><B>Section 3. Records and Signatures Generally. </B>Section seven of
chapter four of the General Laws is hereby amended by striking out the
thirty-eighth clause and inserting in place thereof the following:-

<P>"record", "writing", "signature", and their derived words shall have
the following meanings. "Record" means information that is inscribed on
a tangible medium or that is stored in an electronic or other medium and
is retrievable in perceivable form. "Writing" means a record, including
an electronic record, unless such meaning is clearly inconsistent with
the purpose of a rule of law, provided that the mere requirement that information
be "in writing," "written," or "printed", or use of any other word that
purports to specify or require a particular communications medium, shall
not by itself be sufficient to establish such purpose. "Signature" shall
mean any symbol or method executed or adopted for the purpose intended
by the person it identifies. Where any rule of law requires a written record
or a signed writing, or uses any other words that purport to specify or
require a particular medium for communicating or storing information, that
requirement shall be construed to allow the broadest possible use of electronic
records and electronic signatures unless there is clear public interest
to the contrary.

<P><B>Section 4. Governmental Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures.
</B>The General Laws are hereby amended by inserting after section sixty
four of chapter thirty the following sections:-

<P>Section 65. Definitions.

<P>As used in sections sixty-five to seventy-one the following words shall
have the following meanings:

<P>"Electronic" means electrical, digital, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic,
or any other technology that is similar to these technologies.

<P>"Electronic record" means a record generated, communicated, received,
or stored by electronic means.

<P>"Electronic signature" means any signature attached to or logically
associated with an electronic record.

<P>"Rule of law" means a statute, regulation, ordinance, common-law rule,
court decision, or other law relating to a governmental transactions enacted,
established, or promulgated by the Commonwealth or any agency, commission,
department, court, other authority, or political subdivision of the Commonwealth.

<P>Section 66. Scope.

<P>(a) Sections sixty-five to seventy-one shall apply to records generated,
stored, processed, communicated, or used for any purpose by or with a public
entity of the Commonwealth. The provisions of sections sixty-five to seventy-one
shall not apply:
<DIR>
<DIR>(i) if their application would involve a construction of a rule of
law that is clearly inconsistent with the purpose of that rule of law,
provided that the mere requirement that information be "in writing," "written,"
"printed," or "signed", or use of any other word that purports to specify
or require a particular communications medium, shall not by itself be sufficient
to establish such purpose; or

<P>(ii) to any record that serves as a unique and transferable physical
token of rights and obligations including, without limitation, negotiable
instruments and other instruments of title wherein possession of the instrument
is deemed to confer title.</DIR>
</DIR>
(b) Nothing in sections sixty-five to seventy-one shall be construed to
require any public entity of the Commonwealth to use or permit the use
of electronic records or electronic signatures.

<P>Section 67. Electronic Records.

<P>A record may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability
solely because it is in the form of an electronic record. If a rule of
law requires a record to be in writing, or provides consequences if it
is not, an electronic record satisfies that rule of law.

<P>Section 68. Electronic Signatures.

<P>A signature may not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability
solely because it is in the form of an electronic signature. If a rule
of law requires a signature, or provides consequences in the absence of
a signature, an electronic signature satisfies that rule of law.

<P>Section 69. Admissibility into Evidence.

<P>In any legal proceeding, nothing in the application of the rules of
evidence shall apply so as to deny the admissibility of an electronic record
or electronic signature into evidence on the sole ground that it is an
electronic record or electronic signature or on the grounds that it is
not in its original form or is not an original.

<P>Section 70. Records Retention and Originals.

<P>If a rule of law requires that a record be retained or presented in
its original form, or provides consequences if the record is not so retained
or presented, that requirement is met by retaining an electronic record
that accurately reproduces the original record as it existed at the time
in question. Nothing in this section shall preclude any federal or state
agency from specifying additional requirements for the retention of records,
either written or electronic, that are subject to the jurisdiction of such
agency.

<P>Section 71. Role of the Chief Information Officer.

<P>The Chief Information Officer designated in section four-A of chapter
seven shall have the authority to coordinate, oversee, operate, and approve
the use of information security and authentication technologies by any
public entity within the executive department.

<P><B>Section 5. Business Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures
for Contracts. </B>The General Laws are hereby amended by inserting after
section one hundred seven of chapter ninety-three the following section:-

<P>Section 108. Use of Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures by
Business Entities.

<P>(a) A contract between business entities shall not be unenforceable,
nor inadmissible in evidence, on the sole ground that the contract is evidenced
by an electronic record or that it has been signed with an electronic signature.
For purposes of this section, "contract" shall mean a contract for the
sale of goods or services, for the sale or license of digital information,
or for the lease of tangible personal property. The provisions of this
subsection shall not apply if their application would involve a construction
of a rule of law that is clearly inconsistent with the purpose of that
rule of law, provided that the mere requirement that information be "in
writing," "written," "printed," or "signed", or use of any other word that
purports to specify or require a particular communications medium, shall
not by itself be sufficient to establish such purpose.

<P>(b) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent a party from
establishing reasonable requirements with respect to the medium of a record
or the method executed or adopted by a party to sign a record, absent agreement
to the contrary.

<P>(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to mean that electronic
records and electronic signatures do not satisfy legal requirements for
a writing or a signed writing in transactions not covered by this section.

<P><B>Section 6. Severability. </B>If any provisions of this act, or the
applications of such provisions to any person or circumstance are held
invalid or unconstitutional, the other provisions of this act or the application
of such provisions to any person or circumstance other than that as to
which it is held invalid or unconstitutional shall not be affected thereby.

<P><B>Section 7. Effective Date. </B>This act shall take effect upon passage.
