<p><b>Section 1. Short Title. </b>This act shall be known as the "Massachusetts

Electronic Records and Signatures Act".



</p><p><b>Section 2. Purposes and Construction. </b>The provisions of this

act shall be construed:



</p><p>(a) to facilitate and promote electronic commerce and online government

by clarifying the legal status of electronic records and electronic signatures

in the context of writing and signing requirements imposed by law;



</p><p>(b) to permit and encourage the continued expansion of electronic commerce

and online government through the operation of free market forces rather

than proscriptive legislation;



</p><p>(c) to promote public confidence in the validity, integrity and reliability

of electronic commerce and online government; and



</p><p>(d) to promote the development of the legal and business infrastructure

necessary to support and encourage electronic commerce and online government.



</p><p><b>Section 3. Records and Signatures Generally. </b>Section seven of

chapter four of the General Laws is hereby amended by striking out the

thirty-eighth clause and inserting in place thereof the following:-



</p><p>"record", "writing", "signature", and their derived words shall have

the following meanings. "Record" means information that is inscribed on

a tangible medium or that is stored in an electronic or other medium and

is retrievable in perceivable form. "Writing" means a record, including

an electronic record, unless such meaning is clearly inconsistent with

the purpose of a rule of law, provided that the mere requirement that information

be "in writing," "written," or "printed", or use of any other word that

purports to specify or require a particular communications medium, shall

not by itself be sufficient to establish such purpose. "Signature" shall

mean any symbol or method executed or adopted for the purpose intended

by the person it identifies. Where any rule of law requires a written record

or a signed writing, or uses any other words that purport to specify or

require a particular medium for communicating or storing information, that

requirement shall be construed to allow the broadest possible use of electronic

records and electronic signatures unless there is clear public interest

to the contrary.



</p><p><b>Section 4. Governmental Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures.

</b>The General Laws are hereby amended by inserting after section sixty

four of chapter thirty the following sections:-



</p><p>Section 65. Definitions.



</p><p>As used in sections sixty-five to seventy-one the following words shall

have the following meanings:



</p><p>"Electronic" means electrical, digital, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic,

or any other technology that is similar to these technologies.



</p><p>"Electronic record" means a record generated, communicated, received,

or stored by electronic means.



</p><p>"Electronic signature" means any signature attached to or logically

associated with an electronic record.



</p><p>"Rule of law" means a statute, regulation, ordinance, common-law rule,

court decision, or other law relating to a governmental transactions enacted,

established, or promulgated by the Commonwealth or any agency, commission,

department, court, other authority, or political subdivision of the Commonwealth.



</p><p>Section 66. Scope.



</p><p>(a) Sections sixty-five to seventy-one shall apply to records generated,

stored, processed, communicated, or used for any purpose by or with a public

entity of the Commonwealth. The provisions of sections sixty-five to seventy-one

shall not apply:

</p><dir>

<dir>(i) if their application would involve a construction of a rule of

law that is clearly inconsistent with the purpose of that rule of law,

provided that the mere requirement that information be "in writing," "written,"

"printed," or "signed", or use of any other word that purports to specify

or require a particular communications medium, shall not by itself be sufficient

to establish such purpose; or



<p>(ii) to any record that serves as a unique and transferable physical

token of rights and obligations including, without limitation, negotiable

instruments and other instruments of title wherein possession of the instrument

is deemed to confer title.</p></dir>

</dir>

(b) Nothing in sections sixty-five to seventy-one shall be construed to

require any public entity of the Commonwealth to use or permit the use

of electronic records or electronic signatures.



<p>Section 67. Electronic Records.



</p><p>A record may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability

solely because it is in the form of an electronic record. If a rule of

law requires a record to be in writing, or provides consequences if it

is not, an electronic record satisfies that rule of law.



</p><p>Section 68. Electronic Signatures.



</p><p>A signature may not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability

solely because it is in the form of an electronic signature. If a rule

of law requires a signature, or provides consequences in the absence of

a signature, an electronic signature satisfies that rule of law.



</p><p>Section 69. Admissibility into Evidence.



</p><p>In any legal proceeding, nothing in the application of the rules of

evidence shall apply so as to deny the admissibility of an electronic record

or electronic signature into evidence on the sole ground that it is an

electronic record or electronic signature or on the grounds that it is

not in its original form or is not an original.



</p><p>Section 70. Records Retention and Originals.



</p><p>If a rule of law requires that a record be retained or presented in

its original form, or provides consequences if the record is not so retained

or presented, that requirement is met by retaining an electronic record

that accurately reproduces the original record as it existed at the time

in question. Nothing in this section shall preclude any federal or state

agency from specifying additional requirements for the retention of records,

either written or electronic, that are subject to the jurisdiction of such

agency.



</p><p>Section 71. Role of the Chief Information Officer.



</p><p>The Chief Information Officer designated in section four-A of chapter

seven shall have the authority to coordinate, oversee, operate, and approve

the use of information security and authentication technologies by any

public entity within the executive department.



</p><p><b>Section 5. Business Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures

for Contracts. </b>The General Laws are hereby amended by inserting after

section one hundred seven of chapter ninety-three the following section:-



</p><p>Section 108. Use of Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures by

Business Entities.



</p><p>(a) A contract between business entities shall not be unenforceable,

nor inadmissible in evidence, on the sole ground that the contract is evidenced

by an electronic record or that it has been signed with an electronic signature.

For purposes of this section, "contract" shall mean a contract for the

sale of goods or services, for the sale or license of digital information,

or for the lease of tangible personal property. The provisions of this

subsection shall not apply if their application would involve a construction

of a rule of law that is clearly inconsistent with the purpose of that

rule of law, provided that the mere requirement that information be "in

writing," "written," "printed," or "signed", or use of any other word that

purports to specify or require a particular communications medium, shall

not by itself be sufficient to establish such purpose.



</p><p>(b) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent a party from

establishing reasonable requirements with respect to the medium of a record

or the method executed or adopted by a party to sign a record, absent agreement

to the contrary.



</p><p>(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to mean that electronic

records and electronic signatures do not satisfy legal requirements for

a writing or a signed writing in transactions not covered by this section.



</p><p><b>Section 6. Severability. </b>If any provisions of this act, or the

applications of such provisions to any person or circumstance are held

invalid or unconstitutional, the other provisions of this act or the application

of such provisions to any person or circumstance other than that as to

which it is held invalid or unconstitutional shall not be affected thereby.



</p><p><b>Section 7. Effective Date. </b>This act shall take effect upon passage.
