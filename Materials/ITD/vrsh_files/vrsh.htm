<h1>Toward a Virtual State House </h1>
</center>


The Information Technology Division is exporing the possibility of using online virtual reality technology to enhance the service quality and ease of use for citizens and businesses who use the state's web site to get information from the state and conduct transactions with the government.  The purpose of this inquiry is to explore ways to use powerful new VR technology over the Internet as a means of better organizing and viewing public information and interacting with other citizens and the government.  A VR State House can leverage the large amount of valuable public information now available on the official Massachusetts web site in html format.  In addition to merely providing a static VR &quot;front end&quot; to the state's web site, a VR State House can provide an intuitive interface for citizens to interact with the information and with each other.  



<p>



Several private or corporate VR sites are popping up around the Internet.  The philosophy behind the VR State House inquiry is that the emerging virtual world should include truly &quot;public&quot; space.  That is, space with civic significance where people can exercise their rights and duties as citizens.  What if you could participate in a public hearing being conducted in Boston in one of the legislative hearing rooms without going to Boston - or even leaving your house?  The un-intuitive &quot;Internet chat&quot; can be replaced by three dimensional hearing rooms and representations of the people &quot;present&quot; -  right on your computer screen.  Multi-user networked virtual spaces make possible communications that could not happen in real space.  The ability to share large volumes of information and to collaboratively draft documents and other materials is unprecedented.  



<p>



Unfortunately, today the chances are quite high that you have no idea about public information, much less hearings, that directly effect you and your family.  The Internet can provide a more even distribution of information to people from across the state about civic issues and events that impact them.  Individual citizens usually do not have the resources to track legislation and other important issues, or to hire a lobbying firm to do it for them.  Citizens further away from Boston are at an additional disadvantage based on simple geography.  Virtual Reality interface to public information can help make the most of the potential of the Internet as an information equalizer.  To the extent that a VR model can show obvious connections between data models, citizens looking at information for the first time can make more sophisticated judgments that would otherwise require more study of rows of numbers and columns of text.  The ability to more intuitively display information, and to make that information more malleable depending on how the viewer wants to look at it is a strength of VR.  When added to the capacity to interact with the information, with other citizens and with government officials, VR can become a potent civic tool.



<p>


There are a number of ways to view government.  It is possible with a VR representation of information to chose the most logical or efficient mental model, and base the virtual architecture on that model.  For instance, one way to think of government is as a lot of legislation that starts in the House or the Senate and eventually is presented to the Governor to become law and perhaps later appears before the courts where further law is made.  What if you could literally see the movement of various legislative objects as they make their way through the process?  What if legislation pertaining to subjects you were interested in was a different color, or shape so you could easily observe it?  Another way to think about the government is as a lot of money that starts with the tax, fee and fine payer and winds up in various public programs.  What if you could literally see how much of the government's proposed budget was proportioned to each program?  What if all legislation appeared as large or small as the amount of money it would cost?  What if you could see the whole budget as a gold brick at the start of the year, and witness chunks taken out of the brick as the money was spent - and what if you could really see where it was going?



<p>



 Our intent is not to arrive at a very literal VR replication of the brick and mortar State House, but rather to design the space in a way that is more logical, intuitive and responsive to the citizens who are seeking to move through the space to get information and interact.  The result will probably be a virtual space that resembles the actual State House in few respects.  One possibility is that the constitution will be used as a blue print.  In that case, the space would be divided into the three branches of government (the judiciary, the legislature and the executive).  Another possibility is that the space could reflect the line items spent in the budget (this much for the courts, this much for welfare, that much for education and so on).  Or, perhaps the space can be programmed to reflect the information that is important to the citizens who are in the space.  For instance, a program can be written that would bring parts of the virtual space further into the foreground when those places are accessed more frequently - thus the space would change to accommodate the needs of people going to the space.  The next team meeting  -  which will focus on choosing a design, will prove to be one of the most important cornerstones of the project.
<p>
At this stage, we don't know exactly what design or functionality a VR State House will finally have.  It is entirely possible that none of the above musings will be reflected in the final outcome.  What we are trying to do is solve a deeper problem than any one particular technical application of VR or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol functions.  Our goal is to see whether there are better ways to present data and to further the civic interest through the use of virtual reality and other web based technology.
