<strong>
<font size="7"><p align="center">Request for Information</p>

</font><font size="6"></font></strong></p><p align="center"><strong><font size="6">Secure On-Line Transactions</font></strong></p>

<strong><font size="6"><font size="4"><p align="center">Thursday, April 24, 1997</p>
</font> </font></strong>
<font size="6"> 
<font size="2">
</font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">The Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, acting through the on-line Government Task Force, is
contemplating the release of one or more procurements for electronic
commerce products and/or services. This Request for Information (RFI)
is intended to solicit information that could be useful in drafting
subsequent RFRs. This RFI specifically seeks information on products
and/or services that will enable the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to
use the Internet and internal networks for secure messaging and
transactions.</font></font></p>


<font size="6"><font size="2"><strong><p align="center">Section 1:  Background </p></strong>
 
</font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">The Chief Information
Officer for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has convened the On-Line
Government Task Force to chart the immediate future course of on-line
government in Massachusetts. The Task Force consists of representatives
from a number of different agencies, departments and offices of the
Commonwealth. The Task Force is investigating solutions that improve
efficiency and service quality using internal and Internet-based
electronic communications that possess authentication (to achieve
access control as well as non-repudiation), integrity, and
confidentiality.</font></font></p>
<font size="6"><font size="2"> 
</font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">The Commonwealth has
made information technology (IT) development and electronic
communications a priority, spending approximately $350 million on IT
annually. The Commonwealth seeks to make a large number of routine
business transactions available over the Internet and internal
networks, with the intent that they will be performed for less cost and
conducted at a higher quality service level for citizens, regulated
entities, vendors and others. The Commonwealth seeks to create methods
for secure access to a number of business transactions via electronic
media, including licensing, permitting, applications, filings,
procurement and a host of other functions. Internally, the Intranet is
being looked at as a potential mechanism to alleviate the crush of
paper associated with a large number of routine state government
functions, including personnel, procurement drafting, and other
collaborative data sharing, work flow or messaging applications. </font></font></p>
<font size="6"><font size="2"> 
</font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">Today, the Registry of
Motor Vehicles (RMV) processes a number of transactions and accepts
credit card payment over the state web site. The RMV transactions
assure the confidentiality of credit card data over the Internet by use
of public key cryptography implemented with the SSL 2 protocol. The
Division of Banks (DOB) has embarked on a pilot project to receive
authenticated on-line filings by banks over the state web site. The DOB
pilot assures the data is confidential and the identity of the filing
bank and individual filer is authenticated by use of public key
cryptography implemented with the SSL 3 protocol. The banks
participating in the DOB pilot are issued standard X.509v3 digital
certificates associated with the bank public key. </font></font></p>
<font size="6"><font size="2"> 
</font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">While the Task Force is
interested in all relevant replies to this request for information,
responses that propose cost effective and currently available methods
to assure non-repudiation are of particular interest. Non-repudiation
means a method to prevent or sufficiently rebut subsequent denial of
transmittal or receipt of a given message or participation in a given
transaction. In some cases, this non-repudiation must be capable of
tying an individual to a particular piece or set of data at a
particular time. For non-repudiation, mere access control based on an
SSL 3 implementation of public key cryptography and digital
certificates will not suffice, unless some additional technique exists
to bind the identity of a given party to the message or transaction
engaged in by that party.</font></font></p>

<font size="6"><font size="2"><strong> <p align="center">Section 2:  Purpose of RFI</p></strong>
 
</font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">The Task Force seeks
responses from vendors which offer information about currently-
available solutions to any or all of the following business needs and
example applications:</font></font></p>
<font size="6"><font size="2"> 
<strong> <p>2.1  Internet access with Authentication. </p></strong>
 
</font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">Such an application would involve access via the Internet to Commonwealth data located behind the firewall.  </font></font></p>
<font size="6"><font size="2"> 
 </font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">Example:</font></font></p>
<font size="6"><font size="2"> 
</font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">Certain companies, for a
legitimate business purpose, need to know the driving records of
certain employees. A solution is needed that will allow a pre-selected
group of companies to access employee driver histories and determine
driver status from a state database. Access control is required to
allow companies to access only the driving records of their employees.</font></font></p>
<font size="6"><font size="2"> 
 </font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">General Considerations:</font></font></p>
<font size="6"><font size="2"> 
</font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">Authentication, in the
example above, is being utilized to assure access control to defined
data on the network. Assuming the data is being viewed with a web
browser, then some provision may also be required to assure the data
remains confidential and has not been altered while in transit over the
Internet. </font></font></p>
<font size="6"><font size="2"> 
<strong> </strong></font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2"><strong>2.2  Internet-based data submission with non-persistent connection.</strong></font></font></p>
<font size="6"><font size="2"> 
</font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">Such an application
would involve access via the Internet to a Commonwealth database behind
the firewall for the purpose of submitting information. </font></font></p>
<font size="6"><font size="2"> 
 </font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">Example 1:</font></font></p>
<font size="6"><font size="2"> 
</font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">For the purpose of
posting requests for response as part of a procurement, certain users
would be allowed access to a state procurement services database,
provided authentication and non-repudiation is available for each
submission.</font></font></p>
<font size="6"><font size="2"> 
 </font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">Example 2:</font></font></p>
<font size="6"><font size="2"> 
</font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">For the purpose of
applying for a professional or commercial license renewal, certain
users would be allowed access to a state license database, where the
application form would be electronically delivered. As in the previous
example, non-repudiation is required to prevent the applicant from
denying information submitted in the application and to provide proof
that the state received a particular application.</font></font></p>
<font size="6"><font size="2"> 
 </font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">General Considerations:</font></font></p>
<font size="6"><font size="2"> 
</font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">The posting of bids in
response to a procurement and the submission of a license application
raise a number of issues that are unique to those processes. The
Commonwealth will be performing a number of other transactions as well,
including grant applications, on-line permitting and various filings
with state agencies. The Commonwealth will pursue some transactions
under this category (Internet-based data submission with non-persistent
connection) that will not require non-repudiation. Some of these
transactions would require only front-end authentication for access
control, other transactions would not require authentication of the
identity of the person submitting data for either access control or
non-repudiation. However, the Task Force is particularly interested in
information relating to non-repudiation.</font></font></p>
<font size="6"><font size="2"> 
<strong> <p>2.3  Internet-based data exchange with persistent connection.</p></strong>
 
</font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">Such an application
would involve access via the Internet to an on-line application located
behind the firewall such that the user would be authenticated once, and
the system would maintain the identity of the user in all portions of
the application throughout the duration of the session. </font></font></p>
<font size="6"><font size="2"> 
 </font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">Example: </font></font></p>
<font size="6"><font size="2"> 
</font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">For the purpose of
negotiating and crafting contract agreements, both state users and
non-governmental users would be allowed access to a common document
management and electronic workflow application, with all users
considered "members" of the workflow and able to perform tasks in the
workflow. The application front-end allows users to submit documents,
edit documents and query databases behind the firewall.</font></font></p>

<strong> <p align="center">Section 4:  Other Considerations</p></strong>
 
</font></font><p><font size="6"><font size="2">Interested vendors may
provide information regarding products, services and/or integrated
solutions that address either some or all of the above-mentioned
business needs. The purpose of this RFI is to provide the Commonwealth
with information that could be useful in developing one or more RFRs
for secure on-line transactions and messaging. Please feel free to
respond to any specific questions in this RFI or to offer any other
information that you feel could be useful to the Commonwealth in making
decisions about an RFR. In addition to the questions raised in the
previous sections, the Commonwealth is interested in information on the
following. </font></font></p>
