<h2>ONLINE GOVERNMENT AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE:<br>
          The Proper Role of State Government<br>
Friday, April 4, 1997</h2></center>
<p>

</p><h2>THE STATE GOVERNMENT AS  INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE MAKER</h2>
<p>
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is Lowering Costs and Increasing
Service Quality to the Customer Through such efforts as the Online
Government Task Force and the Public Access Architecture Group.  We are
Leveraging our Wide Area Network and the Internet as business tools. 
</p><p>
There are over 40 distinct projects planned or underway in the
Commonwealth that involve conducting business transactions over the
Internet or Intranet as a key program component.  From licensing to
grant applications, the direction of state governments across the
country is toward online communications.  For example, today, any
citizen can go to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts web site and renew
her vehicle registration, pay a citation, even order a vanity license
plate - all with a confidential encrypted session to protect the credit
card payment information.  This trend among state governments has been
confirmed by a recent NASIRE survey.
</p><p>
For networks to be made into truly useful business tools, a broader more
readily available information infrastructure must be created.  State
governments, again, serve an important role.  For instance, the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts Information Technology Division is now in
the process of two important information infrastructure projects.  One
initiative would leverage federal Universal Access money and state money
with local contributions to lay a high capacity network architecture to
every municipality or school district in Massachusetts.  We are
currently accepting proposals from vendors who seek to enable this
statewide network.  The other initiative involves leasing state
government real property at relatively high altitudes to wireless
communications companies for the placement of communications towers.  
The resulting wireless communications coverage will also strengthen the
information infrastructure of this state and the lease money can be
applied to still more information technology projects.  
</p><p>
In addition to the physical infrastructure, many sets of transactions
have information security needs as well.  Authentication, privacy,
message integrity, audit trails and other requirements are common -
especially for business applications.  There are a number of
technologies that can accommodate some or all of these requirements,
however, several states are exploring public key cryptography as a
potential solution.  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has implemented a
"first of its kind" pilot project utilizing public key cryptography and
digital certificates to enable banks to file documents over our web site
with the Division of Banks.  As the Commonwealth and other states begin
to lay a public key infrastructure, we are exploring another important
component to the general information infrastructure which will support
secure electronic commerce. 
</p><p>
</p><h2>THE STATE GOVERNMENT AS MARKET MAKER</h2>
<p>
In the case of the high capacity statewide network procurement, the
aggregation of demand is having the effect of accelerating service
offerings be vendors that would otherwise have been rolled out over a
longer period of time.  In some cases, services are being offered in
response to the initiative that would not have been offered under
ordinary, uncoordinated purchase conditions.  State governments are
large information technology consumers.  State governments, in their
respective geographic jurisdictions, are influential market players. 
</p><p>
As a taxpayer funded enterprise, State Governments have a duty to use
market power to leverage the most economical deals available.  However,
there lies a deeper public good than merely muscling vendors to provide
products and services at the least cost feasible.  It is widely
recognized that the emergence of ubiquitous and secure electronic
commerce is in the public interest.  It is beyond the power of any given
State Government to enable such a system, not least because the medium
is multi-jurisdictional by nature.  Furthermore, working in isolation,
State Governments run the risk developing requirements and practices
that conflict with each other and thereby impede the natural evolution
of private sector electronic commerce.  By contrast, working in concert,
State Governments have the combined policy and purchase power to
catalyze the emergence of a robust private sector market for online
secure transactional products, services and business systems.  
      </p><p>
To this end, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has been an active
partner with NASIRE in an exciting project involving several states and
private sector partners.  The public and private sector participants are
working together to identify or develop business and technical
electronic commerce practices.  The private sector is clearly going to
be the source of the most efficient and desirable electronic commerce
solutions.  However, State Governments can play a useful mediating role
in the development of rational and harmonized cross-boarder online
commercial systems by coordinating requirements for things like online
registrations, filings, applications, payments and other transactions. 
A guiding philosophy behind Commonwealth of Massachusetts information
technology policy is the belief that private citizens and business'
should be able to use the same systems for online transactions with the
state that they use for private electronic commercial transactions. 
State governments, working with private sector partners and others, are
in the process of reaching agreements and understandings to realize this
goal.
</p><p>
</p><h2>THE STATE GOVERNMENT AS LAW MAKER</h2>
<p>
Important though it may be, perhaps too much emphasis has been paid to
the role of Government as law maker.  An initial, and probably
counterproductive, assumption is often made that the lack of a
comprehensive statutory and regulatory framework is holding back
electronic commerce.  The Administration of Governor William Weld has
found consistently over the past six years that restraining the
government impulse to regulate private enterprise results in more, not
less, economic activity.  The Weld Administration has just concluded an
unprecedented phaseout of antiquated or overly burdensome regulation
throughout every corner of the state bureaucracy.  Particularly in an
area as dynamic and fast growing as the information technology economy,
government at all levels must temper the regulatory urge with a healthy
respect for the power of markets to develop the least costly, highest
quality most efficient technical, business and contractual solutions. 
Government remains, of course, a player in the online market by virtue
of consumer power and transactional standards setting.  The most
effective use of government law making power in support of electronic
commerce would probably be a nice, big, targeted tax cut.  Governor Bill
Weld has pledged his best efforts to fight for cyberspace as a tax free
zone at the state and federal levels.  
</p><p>
Due to the vast array of existing laws and regulations drafted for the
industrial age, several so-called "quill pen laws" remain on the books
and have the effect of hampering the transition to online transactions. 
Laws requiring documents to be "written on paper" and "signed in ink"
have the effect of creating legal obstacles to online commerce.  All
levels of government have an obligation to reform such laws under their
jurisdiction.  At the last meeting of this Committee in New Orleans, you
were introduced to the draft Massachusetts Electronic Records and
Signature Act of 1997.  This statute would ensure the legal sufficiency
of electronic signature and records in transactions with the state,
private sector transactions and under the rules of evidence in a court
of law.   The approach is high level, technology-neutral and
non-regulatory.  The hope is that all jurisdictions will adopt this type
of legislation to create a stable, predicable legal infrastructure to
support electronic commerce and online government.  Earlier this week,
the Commonwealth's Information Technology Division was asked to testify
before the Rhode Island legislature on a bill substantially similar to
the Massachusetts draft.  Other jurisdictions are also pursuing this
legislative course.  I would request the feedback of this esteemed
committee on the current draft Massachusetts legislation.
</p><p>
</p><h2>THE STATE GOVERNMENT AS POLICY MAKER</h2>
<p>
The decisions made within State Governments relating to information
technology have profound impact within and beyond their boarders. 
Issues relating to the creation of Information Infrastructures, effects
on the market and the promulgation of legally binding requirements are
all fundamental to the evolution of electronic commerce and online
government.  States truly are the laboratories of experimentation. 
States, by virtue of their size and heritage, are in a good position to
move relatively quickly and also to wield significant influence,
especially when working together.   States are also closer to the
citizenry and constituent business communities that national and
international bodies that seek to map the future of electronic
commerce.  As such, states are a remarkably responsive, accountable and
dynamic layer of government.  These qualities are among the strongest
virtues to be sought in the public sector as our nation and the world
transitions to the digital age.  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is
working hard to meet the challenge of devising responsible, thoughtful
and proactive policy.
